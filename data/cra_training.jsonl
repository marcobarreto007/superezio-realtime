This helps ensure objectivity and transparency, and introduces an element of independence into the government's economic and fiscal forecast.\nThe Department of Finance regularly surveys private sector forecasters for their outlook. Given the speed and scale of recent U.S. trade policy shifts, private sector forecasts have been revised frequently. The economic forecast reported here is based on a survey conducted in August 2025. The survey results have been adjusted to incorporate the actual results of the National Accounts for the second quarter of 2025 released on August 29, 2025.\nThe August survey includes the views of 11 private sector economists:\nBMO Capital Markets;\nCIBC World Markets;\nThe Conference Board of Canada;\nDesjardins;\nIndustrial Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc.;\nLaurentian Bank Securities;\nNational Bank Financial Markets;\nRoyal Bank of Canada;\nScotiabank;\nTD Bank Financial Group; and,\nThe University of Toronto (Policy and Economic Analysis Program).\nReflecting the shift in U.S. trade policy toward greater protectionism and the importance of exports to income generation across Canada the private sector outlook for real and nominal gross domestic product (GDP) in Canada has been significantly downgraded since the\n2024\nFall Economic Statement\n(FES 2024) (Table A1.1). While the full effects will take time to materialise, higher U.S. tariffs and resulting trade uncertainty are expected to weigh persistently on Canadian economic performance, putting the economy on a lower trajectory.\nIn the August survey, private sector forecasters incorporated the tariff measures and trade policy developments available at the time, and formed their own assumptions regarding the evolution and potential resolution of trade conflicts. These assumptions underpin their projections for GDP growth, trade flows, and the broader macroeconomic outlook. Private sector economists expected current sectoral tariffs and those applied on non-CUSMA (Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement) compliant goods to remain in place through the end of 2025 and most of 2026. While some de-escalation is assumed over time, forecasters did not anticipate a return to broadly open, low-tariff global trade.\nFurthermore, the baseline outlook assumes that trade uncertainty will remain elevated through 2026, reflecting ongoing tariff threats and a likely complex review of the CUSMA. This prolonged uncertainty is expected to weigh on business investment and dampen household confidence. A partial easing of uncertainty is embedded in the outlook beginning in 2027.\nComparisons of the August survey real GDP growth forecast to those of other institutions can be found in Table A1.2.\nFollowing growth of 2.0 per cent annualised in the first quarter of 2025, real GDP contracted by 1.6 per cent in the second quarter, leaving growth at 0.2 per cent in the first half of the year. Forecasters expect growth to resume but to remain modest in the second half of the year amid trade uncertainty. Exports are expected to remain subdued as U.S. tariffs drive demand away from Canadian steel, aluminum, copper, lumber, and autos. Domestic demand continues to moderate in the near term as businesses reduce investment in the face of uncertainty. Households built up precautionary savings due to concerns about employment prospects. Nonetheless, consumption is expected to be the main driver of growth over the near term as households are supported by improved balance sheets and lower interest rates. Real GDP growth is projected to gradually pick up through 2026, supported by export stabilisation and a gradual pickup in domestic demand with lower interest rates.\nOverall, private sector forecasters expect real GDP growth of 1.1 per cent in 2025 and 1.2 per cent in 2026--down sharply from the FES 2024 outlook of 1.9 per cent and 2.1 per cent, respectively. As the Canadian economy gradually adjusts to the new trading environment, growth is expected to pick up to about 2 per cent in 2027 and beyond. However, economic activity remains on a permanently lower trajectory, reflecting the combined effects of ongoing U.S. tariffs and trade tensions weakening productivity, reduced business investment, costs from restructuring trade and supply chains, and the resulting drag on incomes nationwide. Overall, the level of real GDP is about 1.8 per cent lower than forecast in FES 2024.\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

Use apenas informações oficiais do governo canadense."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Explique sobre: Annex 1: Details of economic and fiscal projections | Budget 2025"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The unemployment rate is expected to peak at 7.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, averaging 7.0 per cent in 2025 (compared to 6.7 per cent expected in FES 2024) as trade tensions weigh on labour demand. The unemployment rate is expected to remain elevated and to only gradually decline to reach 6.0 per cent by 2029, about two years later than projected in FES 2024, pointing to persistent excess supply.\nPrivate sector economists anticipate that the disinflationary effects of the fuel charge removal and excess supply will largely offset the direct and indirect cost pressures from tariffs and supply chain disruptions. As a result, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is projected to average 2.1 per cent in 2025, slightly above the 2.0 per cent forecast in FES 2024. Inflation is then expected to return to 2.0 per cent in 2026 and remain at that level over the forecast horizon, in line with the FES 2024 projection. Since the August survey, Canada has removed most countermeasures put in place in March 2025 on U.S. imports, with this change effective September 1, 2025.\nThe survey was consistent with the Bank of Canada bringing the policy interest rate to 2.25 per cent by year-end. The Bank of Canada cut the policy rate by 25 basis points on October 29 bringing it to this level. Economists in the survey expected the policy rate to remain at 2.25 per cent through 2026. Short-term interest rates are expected to be about 30 basis points lower on average than forecast in FES 2024, settling around 2.6 per cent by the end of the forecast period in 2029.\nCanadian long-term yields have declined somewhat over the past few months to stand around 3.1 per cent, reflecting weakening domestic economic data and renewed expectations of interest rate cuts. Private sector economists expect the 10-year bond rate to increase from an average of 3.3 per cent in 2025 to 3.6 per cent in 2029 (about 15 basis points higher than in FES 2024). The increase in long-term yields over the forecast reflects the expectation of larger global sovereign borrowing needs, particularly in the U.S. and Europe.\nAt the time of the survey, forecasters expected real GDP growth in the U.S. to slow to below 1 per cent annualised in the second half of the year reflecting the introduction of tariffs and increased policy uncertainty. U.S. growth has so far in 2025 remained robust as a surge in AI related investment spending is driving building activity. Economists expected U.S. growth to average 1.6 per cent in both 2025 and 2026 (previously 1.7 per cent and 2.0 per cent, respectively), and to strengthen to about 2 per cent in the outer years (similar to the FES 2024 outlook).\nWith global growth prospects being revised down compared to FES 2024 and growing oil supply from strong production by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), private sector economists expected crude oil prices to average US$66 per barrel this year and US$65 per barrel in 2026, previously US$77 and US$76 per barrel respectively. Crude oil prices are expected to gradually increase thereafter to reach US$71 per barrel by 2029, remaining below the US$77 per barrel expected in FES 2024.\nGDP inflation came in flat in the second quarter of 2025, partly offsetting the strength of the end of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. GDP inflation is expected to average 2.4 per cent in 2025 and 1.8 per cent in 2026 (compared to 2.0 per cent in both years in the FES). In the outer years, GDP inflation is broadly similar to the FES outlook.\nReflecting downward revisions to real GDP, the level of nominal GDP is expected to be lower by $8 billion in 2025 compared to the FES outlook. This downward revision widens substantially to $45 billion in 2026, reflecting the downgrade to both real GDP growth and GDP inflation outlook in 2026. Over the forecast horizon (2025-2029), the level of nominal GDP is lower than the FES 2024 projection by $40 billion on average per year.\nForecasters in the survey saw greater risks to the downside for Canada's economic outlook given the potential for additional U.S. sectoral tariffs, the risk that existing tariffs and spillovers could weigh more heavily on growth than anticipated, and a substantial repricing in financial markets. Should U.S. tariffs remain in place and uncertainty lingers, Canadian growth could slow further, delaying the rebound currently expected for late 2026 and beyond. To support prudent economic and fiscal planning amidst heightened global and trade uncertainty, the Department of Finance Canada has developed scenarios to assess the implications of these risks for the economic and fiscal outlook (see below for details).\nTable A1.1\nAverage Private Sector Forecasts\nper cent, unless otherwise indicated\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2025-\n2029\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

Subsequent tables provide details on the outlook for capital investments and the day-to-day operating balance (Tables A1.4 and A1.5), and economic and fiscal developments including, for example, year-to-date financial results (Table A1.6).\nOverall trade uncertainty and the economy's slowdown have weakened the fiscal outlook, particularly through 2026-27 as lower GDP growth and higher spending associated with relief measures weigh on the budgetary balance. Against this uncertainty, Budget 2025 invests to build strength at home guided by fiscal anchors--balance operating spending with revenues by 2028-29 and maintaining a declining deficit-to-GDP ratio.\nBudget 2025 meets both fiscal anchors. As shown in Table A1.3, a deficit of $78.3 billion, or 2.5 per cent of GDP, is expected for 2025-26, falling to 1.5 per cent of GDP by 2029-30. In addition, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio remains relatively stable across the horizon. This responsible fiscal management will help preserve Canada's fiscal advantage.\nTable A1.3\nEconomic and Fiscal Developments, Policy Actions, and Measures Since FES 2024\nbillions of dollars\nProjection\n2024-\n2025\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

A positive number implies an improvement in the budgetary balance (higher revenue or lower expenses).\nPolicy actions taken between FES 2024 and Budget 2025 are detailed in Table A1.18.\nOutlook for Capital Investments\nThe government's fiscal anchors are supported by a new approach to budgeting that prioritises spending that supports capital formation and crowds in private sector investment for long-term growth. This new approach is based on the\nCapital Budgeting Framework\nannounced on October 6, 2025. This framework provides a consistent way to classify spending, including tax expenditures, that contributes to capital formation (called 'capital investment') from day-to-day operating spending. Further details are available in Annex 2.\nTable A1.4 below indicates that capital investments will nearly double from $32.2 billion in 2024-25 to $59.6 billion in 2029-30. Table A1.5 includes projections for day-to-day operating spending, and demonstrates how this spending will be balanced with projected revenues from 2028-29 onwards.\nTable A1.4\nCapital Investments\nbillions of dollars\nProjection\n2024-\n2025\n2025-\n2026\n2026-\n2027\n2027-\n2028\n2028-\n2029\n2029-\n2030\nBaseline capital investments (Annex 2)\n-32.2\n-43.2\n-48.5\n-48.1\n-50.6\n-50.3\nCapital investments since FES 2024\n-1.0\n-1.1\n-1.5\n-1.5\n-1.1\nCapital investments in Budget 2025\n-1.2\n-7.0\n-8.5\n-7.5\n-8.3\nTotal\n-\ncapital investments\n-32.2\n-45.4\n-56.7\n-58.0\n-59.6\n-59.6\nTable A1.5\nDay-to-Day Operating Balance\nbillions of dollars\nProjection\n2024-\n2025\n2025-\n2026\n2026-\n2027\n2027-\n2028\n2028-\n2029\n2029-\n2030\nA.

For Canada, U.S. trade actions are disrupting decades of economic integration which introduces risks to Canada's economic and fiscal outlook and is contributing towards a deterioration in the government's outlook for revenues, expenses, and the budgetary balance.\nWhile it is difficult to isolate the impacts of the U.S. trade actions, the downward revisions to the economic outlook, primarily from 2026-27 onward, could be expected to result in an average estimated deterioration in the budgetary balance of $7 billion per year over the forecast horizon relative to FES 2024.\nU.S. trade actions are creating significant uncertainty for businesses. This dampens the outlook for corporate income tax revenues and net profits from enterprise Crown corporations. Economic assumptions that underpin the lower outlook include lower business activity and increased provisions for credit losses.\nU.S. actions have also created heightened volatility. Year-to-date revenues from customs import duties, for example, have increased substantially due to the countermeasures imposed in response to U.S. tariffs. These duties are sensitive to potential trade policy changes, which could introduce additional volatility in the revenue forecast.\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

Personal income tax revenue has remained strong despite the trade conflict, and both employment and average weekly earnings are up relative to the same time last year. Similarly, other excise taxes have shown limited impact of the trade disruption as indirect effects on consumption have been moderate to date. Looking forward, deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty are expected to create a drag on the fiscal outlook.\nThe government is taking steps to diversify trade and to invest in building Canada strong. These fiscal measures increase spending to support workers and businesses but also to create opportunities.\nOverall, these factors introduce challenges to forecasting as the underlying assumptions affect the projections over the forecast horizon.\nEconomic and Fiscal Developments Since FES 2024\nTable A1.6 shows how much of the change in the budgetary balance since FES 2024 is driven by economic and fiscal developments.

A positive number implies an improvement in the budgetary balance (higher revenues or lower spending).\n2\nIncludes Digital Services Tax (DST) and Underused Housing Tax in this table only for presentation purposes.\n3\nThe largely offsetting revenue and expense impacts of changes in the pollution pricing regime (see box \"Changes to the Pollution Pricing System Since FES 2024\") are netted in row (5), and omitted from the revenue and program expense subtotals of rows (1) and (2).\nBudgetary revenue projections have increased relative to FES 2024 by an average of $7.5 billion annually from 2025-26 to 2029-30, primarily due to stronger corporate income tax revenues, reflecting both stronger anticipated 2024-25 results and continuing strength in 2025-26 year-to-date revenues. This strength has been somewhat offset by lower projected revenue in other streams, including enterprise Crown corporation revenues and other excise taxes and duties.\nFrom 2025-26 onward the outlook for income tax revenues has been revised up, on average, by $8.3 billion annually, largely reflecting higher corporate income tax revenues. Most of the increase is concentrated in the first two years of the forecast horizon, in part reflecting higher expected 2024-25 results and strength in early 2025-26 year-to-date results. In particular, this is driven by higher revenues from the financial sector.\nThe outlook for excise taxes and duties has been revised down in 2025-26 owing to lower year-to-date Goods and Services Tax revenue. Over the remainder of the forecast horizon, the outlook is revised down by an average $0.4 billion per year in line with the projected general slowdown in nominal GDP.\nRevenues generated from Employment Insurance (EI) premiums are projected to be higher from 2025-26 to 2027-28, driven by growth in insurable earnings. Lower employment projections reduce anticipated revenues in the last two years of the forecast.\nOther revenues have been revised down in 2025-26 and over the forecast horizon due to lower expected net profits from enterprise Crown corporations. This is offset by higher expected interest and penalty revenue, net foreign exchange revenue and return on investments.\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

Use apenas informações oficiais do governo canadense."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Explique sobre: Annex 1: Details of economic and fiscal projections | Budget 2025"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The outlook for program expenses has increased relative to FES 2024 by an average of $12.6 billion per year from 2025-26 to 2029-30, largely reflecting higher direct program expenses, primarily from higher projected expenses for contingent liabilities as well as allowance for doubtful accounts on taxes receivable.\nMajor transfers to persons are projected to decrease in 2025-26 and 2026-27 from a reduction in the projected number of beneficiaries receiving elderly benefits, partially offset by higher Employment Insurance benefits in 2026-27. The remainder of the forecast horizon is broadly aligned with FES 2024 projections.\nMajor transfers to provinces, territories, and municipalities have increased slightly due to higher projected Territorial Formula Financing based on higher projected expenditures of provincial and local governments. This is partly offset by lower projected nominal GDP, which results in downward revisions to Equalization and Canada Health Transfer payments in the outer years, and higher projected recoveries with respect to the Quebec Abatement.\nDirect program expenses are higher primarily from expected growth in contingent liabilities, principally due to Indigenous-related claims, as well as allowance for doubtful accounts on taxes receivable.\nSee an \"Update on contingent liabilities\", which shows the growth of contingent liabilities on the balance sheet, net of settlements. This increase reflects the government's efforts to work with Indigenous partners to address past injustices and accelerate the resolution of litigation and the implementation of negotiated settlements to support reconciliation in Canada and is aligned with accounting standards. Growth in contingent liabilities has an impact on the budgetary balance in the year the liabilities are recorded. In recent years, this expense has averaged over $10 billion per year. For prudence, Budget 2025 increases the projection of expenses for contingent liabilities across the forecast horizon, with a larger increase for 2025-26 where there is more information on specific negotiations, cases and claims.\nAn increase in projected expenses across the horizon has also been made for the allowance for doubtful accounts on taxes receivable, in line with the increases seen in 2023-24 and projected in 2024-25, which reflect the growth of the tax base as well as the aging of the associated receivable. Under Canadian public sector accounting standards, tax revenue is recorded as revenue in the year it is earned, while the annual provision for doubtful accounts, to reflect the best estimate of uncollectable amounts receivable, is charged to expenses.\nProjected direct program expenses are also higher from provisions for other obligations such as environmental liabilities and current service costs for pensions and other employee future benefits; and revised timing and spending against previously announced measures.\nPublic debt charges have increased over the forecast horizon primarily due to increased borrowing requirements and long-term interest rates, offset in part by lower short-term interest rates.\nNet actuarial losses, which represent the amortisation of changes in the value of the government's accrued obligations for pensions and other employee future benefits and pension fund assets, are expected to be lower on average over the forecast horizon, reflecting updated actuarial assumptions.\nChanges to the Pollution Pricing System Since FES 2024\nEffective April 1, 2025, the Government of Canada ceased the application of the fuel charge in all jurisdictions where it applied, while maintaining its Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS) for industries in provinces and territories where it applies. At the same time, the federal government also removed requirements for provinces and territories to have a consumer-facing carbon price.\nAll direct proceeds from the federal system are returned over time in the province or territory where they were collected. With the cancellation of the fuel charge effective April 1, 2025, direct fuel charge proceeds return mechanisms for Canadians, small-and-medium-sized businesses, farmers, and Indigenous governments are being wound down. Proceeds from the federal OBPS will continue to be returned either to provincial and territorial governments or via the OBPS Proceeds Fund.\nThe net pollution pricing regime line (5) shown in Table A1.6 consolidates the change since FES 2024 in revenues and expenses from pollution pricing. It reflects net timing differences from winding down the collection of fuel charge proceeds and their corresponding return, while maintaining the OBPS and continuing to honour the return of fuel charge proceeds as specified to small-and-medium-sized businesses, farmers, and Indigenous governments.\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

Softness in the growth of personal income tax revenues primarily reflects measures such as the cancellation of the proposed increase in the capital gains inclusion rate and the reduction of the lowest personal income tax rate. Over the remainder of the forecast horizon, growth in personal income tax revenues is projected to average 4.1 per cent per year.\nCorporate income tax revenues are forecast to remain flat at $97.1 billion in 2025-26 due to fiscal measures such as the cancellation of the proposed increase in the capital gains inclusion rate and the extension of the Accelerated Investment Incentive. Revenue is then expected to decline slightly in 2026-27, before stabilising throughout 2027-28 and 2028-29. In 2029-30, growth in corporate income tax revenues is projected to increase to 3.9 per cent, reflecting a return to the long-term historical trend.\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

These duties are sensitive to potential trade policy changes, which could introduce additional volatility in the revenue forecast.\nOther excise taxes and duties are expected to increase to $13.2 billion in 2025-26, or by 0.8 per cent, as sluggish growth in motive fuels is expected to be offset by other components of the excise taxes, particularly Air Travellers Security Charge. Other excise taxes and duties revenues are projected to grow to $13.6 billion by 2029-30.\nOther taxes include revenues from the two-pillar international tax reform, agreed to on October 2021 by the members of the OECD/G20. Revenues from these taxes are projected to be zero in 2025-26 due to the repeal of the Digital Services Tax and Underused Housing Tax, then grow to $2.1 billion by 2029-30. This primarily reflects the projected revenues from international tax reform that would ensure that multinational enterprises are subject to a minimum 15 per cent tax, no matter where their profits are earned.\nProceeds from the Pollution Pricing Framework\nProceeds from the federal pollution pricing framework are expected to be adjusted down from $13.6 billion in 2024-25 to $0.0 billion in 2025-26 and onwards as the fuel charge ceased to apply effective April 1, 2025. Direct fuel charge proceeds return mechanisms for Canadians, small- and medium-sized businesses, farmers, and Indigenous governments in provinces where the federal fuel charge applied are being wound down. The residual value indicates the amounts related to the Output-Based Pricing System.\nEmployment Insurance Premium Revenues\nEmployment Insurance (EI) premium revenues are forecasted to grow at 2.1 per cent in 2025-26, supported by strength in the labour force and insurable earnings. Over the remainder of forecast horizon, EI premium revenues are projected to grow at an average of 3.4 per cent annually, reflecting steady gains in insurable earnings. In the long term, strength in the upward trend is partially offset by lower projected growth of the labour force.\nThe EI premium rate is projected to be $1.63 per $100 of insurable earnings in 2027. The actual premium rate for 2027 will be set in the fall of 2026, incorporating the recommendation of the Canada Employment Insurance Commission based on projections provided by the Office of the Chief Actuary.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues consist of three broad components:\nEnterprise Crown corporation revenues\nare projected to increase by 40.3 per cent to $11.3 billion in 2025-26, largely reflecting higher expected net profits from the Bank of Canada. Over the remainder of the forecast horizon, growth is projected to average 16.9 per cent annually, driven by net profits of enterprise Crown corporations as well as interest revenues generated from the Government of Canada's purchases of Canada Mortgage Bonds (CMBs). The government will ensure that the pace and volume of CMB purchases are aligned with market conditions.\nOther program revenues\nare projected to decrease by 7.4 per cent to $31.8 billion in 2025-26. This is primarily driven by a decrease in interest and penalty revenue due to lower interest rates, and the waiving of interest and penalties as part of the tax relief and support provided to businesses in response to tariffs. Over the remainder of the forecast horizon, growth is projected to average 4.8 per cent annually.\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

Assets in the Exchange Fund Account are mainly invested in debt securities of sovereigns and their agencies. They are held to aid in the control and protection of the external value of the Canadian dollar and to provide a source of liquidity for the government, if required. Net foreign exchange revenues and return on investments are projected to decline in 2025-26, largely due to lower short-term interest rates. Higher returns over the remainder of the forecast horizon are primarily driven by growth in the level of international reserves and other loans and investments.\nRevenues from Canada's Countermeasures\nAs of October 17, 2025, $6.7 billion in gross revenue has been assessed from Canada's countermeasures in response to U.S. tariffs. This includes 25 per cent tariffs on $30 billion in goods imported from the U.S., 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminum products, and 25 per cent tariffs on vehicles.\nA total of $3.0 billion in revenue has been remitted to mitigate the impact of the countermeasures on the Canadian economy. The net revenue assessed is $3.7 billion and remains subject to revision. As additional claims for remission are processed, the total amount of relief provided will increase, which will result in downward revisions to net revenue assessed. The figures in Chart A1.1 below detail the net revenue assessed as of October 17, 2025. The forecast for net revenues over the forecast horizon, including adjustments for product scope changes, anticipated remissions and other relief, is presented in Table A1.18, titled Policy Actions Since FES 2024.\nNet Revenue Assessed from U.S Countermeasures\nChart A1.1\nEffective September 1, 2025, in recognition of the U.S.'s approach to allow most Canadian goods to enter the U.S. tariff-free under CUSMA, Canada removed countermeasures put in place in March 2025 on most U.S. imports. This includes removing tariffs on $30 billion in goods that had been in place since March 4, 2025 and $14.2 billion in goods that had been in place since March 13, 2025.\nCanada's countermeasures on steel, aluminum and vehicles remain in effect.\nOutlook for Expenses\nTable A1.9 provides an overview of the projection for total expenses by major component.\nTable A1.9\nThe Expense Outlook\nbillions of dollars\nProjection\n2024-\n2025\n2025-\n2026\n2026-\n2027\n2027-\n2028\n2028-\n2029\n2029-\n2030\nMajor transfers to persons\nElderly benefits\n80.3\n83.1\n88.8\n94.5\n99.4\n104.3\nEmployment Insurance benefits\n24.9\n30.5\n31.9\n30.4\n31.3\n32.6\nCanada Child Benefit\n28.6\n30.1\n31.0\n31.7\n32.4\n33.4\nCOVID-19 income support for workers\n-2.2\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nTotal\n131.6\n143.7\n151.8\n156.6\n163.1\n170.3\nMajor transfers to provinces, territories, and municipalities\nCanada Health Transfer\n1\n52.1\n54.7\n57.4\n60.3\n62.5\n65.0\nCanada Social Transfer\n16.9\n17.4\n17.9\n18.5\n19.0\n19.6\nEqualization\n1\n25.3\n26.2\n27.2\n28.1\n29.1\n30.3\nTerritorial Formula Financing\n1\n5.2\n5.5\n5.8\n6.3\n6.6\n6.8\nHealth agreements with provinces and territories\n4.3\n4.3\n4.3\n3.1\n2.5\n2.5\nCanada-wide early learning and child care\n6.6\n7.9\n7.9\n8.0\n8.2\n8.5\nCanada Community-Building Fund\n2.4\n2.5\n2.5\n2.6\n2.6\n2.7\nOther fiscal arrangements\n2\n-7.6\n-7.6\n-8.0\n-8.3\n-8.7\n-9.1\nTotal\n105.1\n110.8\n115.0\n118.5\n121.9\n126.3\nPollution pricing proceeds returned to Canadians\n15.6\n5.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.1\n0.0\nDirect program expenses\nOther transfer payments\n107.1\n115.6\n117.3\n119.6\n119.0\n122.7\nOther direct program expenses\n130.5\n150.2\n144.0\n143.2\n145.7\n148.9\nTotal\n237.6\n265.8\n261.3\n262.8\n264.7\n271.6\nTotal program expenses, excluding net actuarial losses\n489.9\n525.2\n528.4\n537.9\n549.7\n568.3\nPublic debt charges\n53.4\n55.6\n60.0\n66.2\n71.4\n76.1\nTotal expenses, excluding net actuarial losses\n543.3\n580.9\n588.3\n604.1\n621.2\n644.4\nNet actuarial losses (gains)\n4.0\n5.0\n0.2\n0.7\n-3.0\n-4.5\nTotal expenses\nPer cent of GDP\n547.3\n585.9\n588.6\n604.8\n618.1\n639.8\nMajor transfers to persons\n4.3\n4.5\n4.6\n4.6\n4.6\n4.6\nMajor transfers to provinces, territories, and municipalities\n3.4\n3.5\n3.5\n3.5\n3.4\n3.4\nDirect program expenses\n7.7\n8.4\n8.0\n7.7\n7.5\n7.4\nTotal program expenses, excluding net actuarial losses\n15.9\n16.5\n16.1\n15.8\n15.5\n15.4\nTotal expenses\n17.8\n18.4\n18.0\n17.7\n17.4\n17.4\nNote: Totals may not add due to rounding.\n1\nThe Canada Health Transfer, Equalization and Territorial Formula Financing amounts for 2026-27 will be finalised in December 2025, in accordance with the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act.\n2\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

Over the remainder of the forecast horizon, elderly benefits are forecast to grow by 5.9 per cent on average annually. Growth in elderly benefits is due to the increasing population of seniors and projected consumer price inflation, to which benefits are fully indexed.\nEI benefits\nare projected to increase by 22.6 per cent to reach $30.5 billion in 2025-26, largely reflecting a higher projected unemployment rate in 2026. EI benefits are expected to grow at an average of 1.7 per cent annually over the remainder of the forecast horizon.\nCanada Child Benefit\npayments are projected to increase 5.2 per cent to $30.1 billion in 2025-26, largely reflecting the indexation of benefits to consumer price inflation. Payments are expected to grow at an average of 2.7 per cent annually over the remainder of the forecast horizon.\nCOVID-19 income support for workers\nwere provided during the pandemic through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, Canada Recovery Benefits, and the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit. These temporary programs are now closed, with projected amounts in 2024-25 mainly reflecting redeterminations of benefit overpayments.\nMajor Transfers to Provinces, Territories, and Municipalities\nMajor transfers to provinces, territories, and municipalities are expected to increase from $110.8 billion in 2025-26 to $126.3 billion in 2029-30:\nThe\nCanada Health Transfer (CHT)\nis projected to increase from $54.7 billion in 2025-26 to $65.0 billion in 2029-30, supported by the CHT growth guarantee of at least 5 per cent for five years (in effect from 2023-24 to 2027-28), after which it will grow in line with a three-year moving average of nominal GDP growth, with funding guaranteed to grow by at least 3 per cent per year.\nThe\nCanada Social Transfer\nwill increase from $17.4 billion in 2025-26 to $19.6 billion in 2029-30, reflecting legislated growth of 3 per cent per year.\nEqualization payments\nare indexed to the three-year average of nominal GDP growth and are projected to grow 3.7 per cent annually, on average, from $26.2 billion in 2025-26 to $30.3 billion in 2029-30.\nTerritorial Formula Financing\nis projected to grow 5.6 per cent annually, on average, from 2025-26 to 2029-30 due to growth in provincial/local expenditures, which are major components of the formula.\nHealth agreements with provinces and territories\nare projected to remain at $4.3 billion in 2025-26 and 2026-27, reflecting $2.5 billion per year for tailored bilateral agreements, and $1.2 billion per year in transfers supporting home and community care and mental health and addictions services that expire after 2026-27. Another $600 million per year in transfers for long-term care expires after 2027-28.\nCanada-wide early learning and child care transfer payments\nare expected to increase from $7.9 billion in 2025-26 to $8.5 billion in 2029-30, reflecting 3 per cent per year growth for four years starting in 2027-28 as announced in 2025. This also includes $625 million over four years, beginning in 2023-24, for the Early Learning and Child Care Infrastructure Fund.\nCanada Community-Building Fund payments\n, which are indexed at 2 per cent per year with increases applied in $100 million increments, are expected to grow from $2.5 billion in 2025-26 to $2.7 billion in 2029-30.\nOther fiscal arrangements\nare projected to reduce transfers by $7.6 billion in 2025-26 increasing to $9.1 billion by 2029-30 due to the Quebec Abatement. This reflects the value of the historical transfer of tax points to Quebec in the 1960s and 1970s, which results in a commensurate reduction in cash transfers to the province.\nPollution Pricing Proceeds Returned to Canadians\nThe government removed the federal fuel charge effective April 1, 2025; the federal Output-Based Pricing System remains in place. All direct proceeds from the federal pollution pricing system are returned over time in the province or territory where they were collected.\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

Amounts in 2026-27 and beyond reflect the maintenance of the federal Output-Based Pricing System only.\nDirect Program Expenses\nDirect program expenses consist of other transfer payments administered by departments, and other direct program expenses. Growth in direct program expenses from 2025-26 to 2029-30 is expected to average below 1 per cent, compared to 8 per cent in the past decade, taking into account planned expenditure reduction actions including the Comprehensive Expenditure Review. Some expenses such as for Indigenous claims and contingent liabilities can impact either other transfer payments or other direct program expenses.\nOther transfer payments administered by departments are projected to increase from $115.6 billion in 2025-26 to $122.7 billion in 2029-30. Projected growth reflects much of the programming identified under the capital budgeting framework in Annex 2, such as support for electric vehicle battery manufacturing, clean economy investment tax credits, and the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program.\nOther direct program expenses reflect the cost of doing business for more than 100 government departments, agencies, and Crown corporations, as well as an allowance for doubtful accounts on taxes receivable. These expenses are forecasted to decrease from $150.2 billion in 2025-26 to $143.2 billion in 2027-28, from the phase-in of savings under the Comprehensive Expenditure Review beginning in 2026-27, as well as from provisioning for contingent liabilities being higher in 2025-26 than in later years. Gradual growth in later years reflects investments identified in the capital budgeting framework in Annex 2, including capital amortisation expense and expenses of the Canadian Infrastructure Bank; and rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces.\nPublic Debt Charges\nPublic debt charges are expected to increase from $55.6 billion in 2025-26 to $76.1 billion in 2029-30 due to projected increases in the stock of debt and higher interest rates. As a share of GDP, public debt charges are projected to rise from 1.8 per cent in 2025-26 to 2.1 per cent in 2029-30.\nNet Actuarial Losses\nNet actuarial losses, which represent changes in the value of the government's obligations for pensions and other employee future benefits, are expected to decline over most years of the forecast horizon, from a projected loss of $5.0 billion in 2025-26 to a projected net gain of $4.5 billion in 2029-30, reflecting higher expected interest rates used to measure the present value of the obligations. The forecast of these net actuarial losses, including gains in the outer years of the forecast horizon, is volatile and sensitive to projections of future interest rates. To isolate these measurement impacts from underlying trends in government spending, expenses in Table A1.9 and the budgetary balance in Table A1.7 are shown before and after net actuarial losses.\nUpdate on Contingent Liabilities\nConsistent with Canadian public sector accounting standards, the government records a contingent liability when the probability of a future payment is considered likely and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Provisions for contingent liabilities are continuously reviewed and refined in light of new information and changing circumstances. Each year previously recognised contingent liabilities may be reduced or extinguished through payments, while new obligations or revaluations are recorded to reflect updated estimates. The resulting balance represents the stock of outstanding contingent liabilities. Changes in provisions due to revisions in estimates or the addition of new obligations are reflected in direct program expenses in the budget.\nThe majority of the government's contingent liabilities are associated with active alternative dispute resolution processes and pending or potential litigation. As shown in Chart A1.2, total recorded contingent liabilities increased from $13 billion in 2015-16, to a projected $55 billion in 2024-25, net of settlements reached. This increase reflects, in part, the government's efforts to work with Indigenous partners to address past injustices and accelerate the resolution of litigation and the implementation of negotiated settlements to support reconciliation in Canada. Recording a contingent liability in compliance with accounting standards ensures that the fiscal framework is provisioned to deliver on this important priority.\nChart A1.2\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

There can be considerable uncertainty in forecasting what contingent liabilities will eventually be recorded under accounting standards, which are estimates based on the best available information at the time of closing of the Public Accounts. The amounts recorded reflect assumptions about the outcomes of negotiations, cases and claims, as well as methodologies for calculating damages and settlements. Actions are underway to manage this uncertainty through improved visibility and oversight on large areas of contingent liabilities, such as Indigenous-related claims process. In addition, experts are also being engaged on how to improve public communication of contingent liabilities.\nFinancial Source/Requirement\nThe financial source/requirement measures the difference between cash coming into the government and cash going out. In contrast, the budgetary balance is presented on a full accrual basis of accounting, meaning that government revenues and expenses are recorded when they are earned or incurred, regardless of when the cash is received or paid.\nTable A1.10 provides a reconciliation of the two measures, starting with the budgetary balance. Non-budgetary transactions shown in the table reflect the reversal of certain revenues and expenses included in the budgetary balance that have no impact on cash flows in the year, such as the amortisation of non-financial assets. They also include the addition of changes in asset and liability balances that have no accrual impact in a year but do result in the inflow or outflow of cash, such as the payment of accounts payable. An increase in a liability or decrease in an asset represents a financial source, whereas a decrease in a liability or increase in an asset represents a financial requirement. The sum of the budgetary balance and changes in asset and liability balances reflected under non-budgetary transactions is equal to the government's net source of (+), or requirement for (-), cash.\nTable A1.10\nThe Budgetary Balance, Non-Budgetary Transactions, and Financial Source/Requirement\nbillions of dollars\nProjection\n2024-\n2025\n2025-\n2026\n2026-\n2027\n2027-\n2028\n2028-\n2029\n2029-\n2030\nBudgetary balance\n-36.3\n-78.3\n-65.4\n-63.5\n-57.9\n-56.6\nNon-budgetary transactions\nPensions and other accounts\n9.1\n20.4\n3.8\n3.2\n-1.8\n-3.4\nNon-financial assets\n-10.5\n-6.2\n-14.1\n-20.6\n-21.1\n-18.2\nLoans, investments, and advances\nEnterprise Crown corporations\n-61.1\n-66.1\n-47.5\n-48.0\n-49.3\n-31.4\nOther\n-6.6\n-6.7\n-10.0\n-3.4\n-4.8\n-6.5\nTotal\n-67.7\n-72.8\n-57.6\n-51.3\n-54.1\n-37.9\nOther transactions\nAccounts payable, receivable, accruals, and allowances\n-14.6\n-3.1\n-10.5\n-7.8\n-6.3\n-6.1\nForeign exchange activities and derivatives\n-10.0\n2.2\n-5.3\n-5.0\n-5.0\n-4.9\nTotal\n-24.6\n-0.9\n-15.8\n-12.8\n-11.2\n-11.0\nTotal non-budgetary transactions\n-93.7\n-59.5\n-83.6\n-81.5\n-88.2\n-70.5\nFinancial source (requirement)\n-130.0\n-137.9\n-149.0\n-145.0\n-146.1\n-127.0\nAs shown in Table A1.10, a financial requirement is projected in each year over the forecast horizon, reflecting financial requirements associated with the projected budgetary deficits, as well as forecast requirements from non-budgetary activities.\nA financial source is projected for pensions and other accounts for the earlier years of the forecast horizon, followed by projected requirements in the later years. Pensions and other accounts include the activities of the Government of Canada's employee pension plans and those of federally appointed judges and Members of Parliament, as well as a variety of other employee future benefit plans, such as health care and dental plans, and disability and other benefits for veterans and others. A financial source for pensions and other accounts reflects the difference between non-cash pension and benefit expenses recorded as part of the budgetary balance, such as the amortisation of net actuarial losses and the accrual of future benefits earned by employees during the year, and actual cash outflows for benefit payments.\nFinancial requirements for non-financial assets mainly reflect the difference between cash outlays for the acquisition of new tangible capital assets and the amortisation of capital assets included in the budgetary balance. They also include disposals of tangible capital assets and changes in inventories and prepaid expenses. Financial requirements are projected in each year over the forecast horizon, reflecting forecast net growth in non-financial assets.\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

They also include loans, investments, and advances to national and provincial governments and international organisations, and under government programs.\nIn general, loans, investments, and advances are expected to generate additional revenues for the government in the form of interest or additional net profits of enterprise Crown corporations, which partly offset debt charges associated with these borrowing requirements. These revenues are reflected in the budgetary balance projections.\nOther transactions include the payment of tax refunds and other accounts payable, the collection of taxes and other accounts receivable, the conversion of other accrual adjustments included in the budgetary balance into cash, as well as foreign exchange activities and derivatives. Projected net cash requirements for other transactions over the forecast horizon mainly reflect changes in accounts payable and accounts receivable and forecast increases in the government's official international reserves held in the Exchange Fund Account.\nEconomic Scenarios Analysis\nAs a trading nation, Canada depends on exports for roughly one-third of GDP. Our prosperity is closely tied to global demand. However, large increases in U.S. tariffs and the resulting trade uncertainty are weakening Canada's economy. Tariffs reduce global demand for goods and services, disrupt supply chains, and constrain the global economy's productive potential. More directly, tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, autos, copper, softwood lumber, and wood products are putting Canadian jobs and businesses at risk.\nThe Canadian economy has already felt the impact. Real GDP rose at an annualised pace of 0.2 per cent in the first half of 2025. While growth is projected to pick up in the second half of this year, the pace is expected to remain modest, according to forecasters in the August private sector survey.\nCanada retains strong economic fundamentals and the capacity to rebound from short-term shocks. Yet the current trade environment imposes persistent drags on the Canadian economy. Business investment, in particular, is highly sensitive to clarity about future conditions. Ongoing uncertainty about trade policy and demand prospects may prompt businesses to continue delaying or scaling back investment plans.\nLower investment has lasting consequences, reducing Canada's growth potential and productivity over the medium term. Consequently, the medium-term economic performance depends, in no small part, on coordinated action by Canadian governments and private sector actors to sustain economic demand--both domestically and abroad.\nTo facilitate prudent economic and fiscal planning around these risks and to further stress-test the August private sector survey forecast, the Department of Finance has developed downside and upside scenarios of Canada's economic outlook (Table A1.11).\nDownside Scenario\nIn the August survey, forecasters assumed that trade uncertainty will remain elevated in the near term but largely dissipates by 2027. In contrast, in the downside scenario, trade uncertainty persists beyond 2026. This uncertainty may arise for many reasons. For example, it could stem from escalating geopolitical tensions and still ambiguous U.S. tariff plans--broad-based, sectoral, or country-specific--combined with challenges in concluding new agreements.\nBeyond directly discouraging business investment--which lowers the economy's productive capacity--persistent uncertainty in this scenario also has indirect effects on the Canadian economy. Uncertain economic conditions lead firms to maintain precautionary financial buffers, resulting in reduced hiring. Similarly, cautious consumers delay major purchases to protect their finances and increase their saving buffers. Against a backdrop of a weakened global economy and trade environment, Canadian exports face lower demand, while commodity prices and financial asset values fall. Together, these factors contribute to a lower level of real GDP compared to the August survey forecast.\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

The downside scenario incorporates greater challenges in adjusting to U.S. tariffs. For example, manufacturers may need to restructure supply chains, and exporters may need to find new buyers. These shifts come with adjustment costs, while higher tariffs limit future efficiency gains from trade and cross-border cooperation. As a result, the Canadian economy becomes less efficient, with cost pressures for producers and consumers and weaker business activity. Reflecting these challenges, Canadian productivity is lower than projected in the survey forecast.\nCombining the trade uncertainty impacts and lower productivity, the downside scenario embeds a protracted period of slower economic growth and higher unemployment. On average, the level of Canadian nominal GDP is about $51 billion per year below the August survey forecast from 2025 to 2029.\nThe Canadian economy contracts in the third quarter of 2025, with activity stalling in the fourth quarter, and remains sluggish throughout 2026 and 2027. On an annual basis, real GDP growth is 1.0 per cent in 2025, 0.6 per cent in 2026, and 1.4 per cent in 2027. This compares to 1.1 per cent, 1.2 per cent, and 2.0 per cent for 2025, 2026, and 2027 in the August survey. By the end of 2029, the level of real GDP is about 1.0 per cent and 2.7 per cent lower than the forecast levels in the August survey and FES 2024, respectively.\nWeaker economic activity induces businesses to slow hiring and lay off workers, pushing the unemployment rate higher. The unemployment rate remains elevated and above August survey expectations throughout the forecast horizon. The unemployment rate peaks at 7.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2025, followed by an average of 7.2 per cent in 2026 and 6.8 per cent in 2027, compared to 6.8 per cent in 2026 and 6.4 per cent in 2027 in the survey.\nAs a result of weaker economic activity, CPI inflation is lower than in the August survey, at 1.9 per cent in 2026 and 1.7 per cent in 2027, versus 2.0 per cent in both years. Typically, in a context of reduced economic demand, the reduction in CPI inflation would be greater than is modelled in the downside scenario. However, the downside scenario also accounts for a reduction in potential output--arising from reduced capital investment and lower productivity--which offsets part of the downward pressure on inflation.\nIn response to these developments, short-term interest rates remain lower than the survey forecast throughout the forecast horizon. On average, in 2026 and 2027, the 3-month treasury bill rate is at 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively, lower than the survey forecast of 2.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent, respectively.\nGDP inflation is significantly lower as Canada sees a decline in terms of trade due to lower commodity prices and reduced CPI inflation. GDP inflation is 1.4 per cent in 2026 and 2027 versus 1.8 per cent and 2.0 per cent in the August survey.\nUpside Scenario\nIn the upside scenario, trade policy uncertainty--both at home and abroad--eases more quickly than anticipated. At home, efforts to streamline internal trade, bolster competition, and build relationships with global partners help to generate more predictable demand for Canadian goods. Abroad, the U.S. reaches new trade agreements with key partners, and global trade tensions begin to subside by late 2025. This more stable trade backdrop supports stronger investment, higher trade flows, and improved economic confidence worldwide.\nAdditionally, to reflect the ongoing government-wide effort to create a more competitive environment, streamline regulatory processes, and make structural reforms that remove barriers to productivity and investment, the upside scenario illustrates how even modest improvements in productivity--measuring how efficiently labour and capital are combined to produce goods and services--can meaningfully expand Canada's economic capacity and enhance long-term resilience. This higher productivity makes Canadian goods and services more competitive both domestically and internationally, drives private sector investment, and creates opportunities to deliver major nation-building projects faster and better, thereby raising Canadian incomes.\nOverall, a faster normalisation of trade policy uncertainty mainly boosts aggregate demand, while expanded productive capacity through structural policies lifts Canada's overall economic trajectory. On average, the level of nominal GDP is $25 billion higher on average per year from 2025 to 2029 relative to the August survey forecast.\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

Reflecting the compounding effects of improved productivity, by the end of 2029, the level of real GDP is about 0.7 per cent higher than in the August survey, although it remains 1.1 per cent lower than forecast in FES 2024.\nStronger economic growth is reflected in higher job creation and greater labour force participation. The unemployment rate declines more rapidly than in the August survey, averaging 6.7 per cent in 2026 and 6.2 per cent in 2027, compared to 6.8 per cent and 6.4 per cent in the survey.\nUpward price pressures increase as stronger aggregate demand takes hold. However, these are largely offset by productivity gains that expand domestic supply, keeping inflation broadly contained.

Overall revenues are projected to be lower by $10.4 billion, per year. Total expenses would decrease by an average of $1.2 billion per year over the horizon, primarily driven by reduced public debt charges from lower interest rates and reductions in GDP-indexed transfers, partially offset by higher pension and benefit obligation valuations from lower interest rates.\nAs a result of the higher deficits and weaker nominal GDP growth, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio would be expected to rise to 45.3 per cent by 2028-29 and fall to 45.2 per cent by 2029-30.\nUpside Scenario Fiscal Impact\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

Stronger nominal GDP results in higher income tax revenues. Overall, revenues are projected to be $5.0 billion higher annually, on average, in this scenario. Total expenses would be unchanged, on average, with higher public debt charges and major transfers offset by lower pension and benefit obligation valuations from higher interest rates.\nAs a result of the lower deficits and stronger nominal GDP, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio would stabilise near-term and fall more rapidly from 2026-27, reaching 42.2 by 2029-30.\nLong-Term Debt Projections\nKeeping the federal debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path over the long term will help ensure that future generations are not overburdened with debt and that sufficient fiscal room remains to address emerging fiscal pressures, challenges, and risks.\nBuilding on the Budget 2025 forecasts, baseline long-term fiscal projections continue to show the federal debt-to-GDP ratio declining over the long-term projection horizon (Chart A1.5). This conclusion is held under the downside scenario described in the preceding section that leads to higher deficits and federal debt-to-GDP ratios over the budget planning horizon.\nChart A1.5\nLong-Term Federal Debt Projections\nAs with any projection that extends over several decades, the long-term debt-to-GDP ratio projections presented in Budget 2025 are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and are sensitive to assumptions. They should not be viewed as predictions of the future, but instead as modelling scenarios based on a set of reasonable economic and demographic assumptions, assuming no future changes in policies. It is important to note that these projections do not fully reflect positive impacts that can be expected to result from recent and future economic policies. Some future fiscal pressures are also not accounted for in this baseline projection, including, among others, from recessions, additional defence spending, population aging, climate change, and the transition to net-zero emissions.\nTo form the long-term economic projections, the medium-term (2025 to 2029) economic forecasts presented in Budget 2025 are extended to 2055 using the Department of Finance Canada's long-term economic projection model. In this model, annual real GDP growth depends on labour productivity growth (0.8 per cent per year), which is calibrated over its 2000-2024 historical average, and labour supply growth (average of 0.6 per cent per year), which is based on demographic projections produced by Statistics Canada and projections for the labour force participation rate and average hours worked using econometric models developed by the Department. Assuming a constant 2 per cent annual rate for GDP inflation, nominal GDP is projected to grow by an average of 3.5 per cent per year from 2030 to 2055 (Table A1.12).\nTable A1.12\nGDP Growth Projection, Baseline Scenario, Average Annual Growth Rates\nper cent, unless otherwise indicated\n2000-\n2024\n2025-\n2029\n2030-\n2055\nReal GDP growth\nContributions of (percentage points):\nLabour supply growth\n1.3\n0.6\n0.6\nWorking-age population\n1.4\n1.0\n0.8\nLabour force participation\n0.0\n-0.3\n-0.1\nUnemployment rate\n0.1\n0.1\n0.0\nAverage hours worked\n-0.2\n-0.3\n-0.1\nLabour productivity growth\n0.8\n1.0\n0.8\nNominal GDP growth\n4.6\n3.7\n3.5\nNote: Contributions may not add up due to rounding.\nSources: Statistics Canada; Department of Finance August 2025 survey of private sector economists, which has been adjusted to incorporate the actual results of the National Accounts for the second quarter of 2025 released on August 29, 2025; Department of Finance Canada calculations.\nThe long-term federal debt projections are developed through an accounting model in which each revenue and expense category is modelled as a function of its underlying demographic and economic variables, with the relationships defined by a mix of current government policies and assumptions. The key assumptions underlying fiscal projections from 2030-31 through 2055-56 are the following:\nAll tax revenues as well as a direct program expenses grow broadly with nominal GDP, with the exception of a number of programs that will no longer be available after a certain date, such as the Clean Electricity, Clean Technology, and Clean Hydrogen investment tax credits, which are incorporated based on their projected costs.\nThe Canada Health Transfer, Canada Social Transfer, and Equalization grow with their respective legislated escalators. The remaining major transfers to provinces, territories, and municipalities grow according to their respective factors, such as nominal GDP, the respective populations, inflation, and current legislation or agreements.\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of the projected budgetary balance to the following economic shocks relative to Budget 2025 projections:\nA one-year, 1-percentage-point decrease in real GDP growth driven equally by lower productivity and employment growth.\nA decrease in nominal GDP growth resulting solely from a one-year, 1-percentage-point decrease in the rate of GDP inflation (assuming that the Consumer Price Index moves in line with GDP inflation).\nA sustained 100-basis-point increase in all interest rates.\nThese sensitivities are estimates that assume any decrease in economic activity is proportional across income and expenditure components and are meant to provide a broad illustration of the impact of economic shocks on the outlook for the budgetary balance. The sensitivity analysis conducted in this section has been presented routinely in budgets since 1994 and is separate from the upside and downside scenarios presented earlier in this annex. Actual economic shocks may have different fiscal impacts. For example, they may be concentrated in specific sectors of the economy or cause different responses in key economic variables (e.g., GDP inflation and CPI inflation may have different responses to a given shock). Aligned with presentation throughout Budget 2025, the fiscal sensitivities are based on a 4-year time horizon.\nTable A1.15\nEstimated Impact of a 1-Year, 1-Percentage-Point Decrease in Real GDP Growth on Federal Revenues, Expenses and Budgetary Balance\nbillions of dollars\nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 4\nFederal revenues\nTax revenues\nPersonal income tax\n-3.0\n-3.1\n-3.3\nCorporate income tax\n-0.8\n-1.0\n-1.1\nGoods and Services Tax\n-0.5\n-0.5\n-0.6\nOther\n-0.2\n-0.2\n-0.2\nTotal tax revenues\n-4.5\n-4.8\n-5.2\nEmployment Insurance premiums\n0.2\n1.0\n1.0\nOther revenues\n-0.1\n-0.1\n-0.2\nTotal budgetary revenues\n-4.4\n-3.9\n-4.4\nFederal expenses\nMajor transfers to persons\nElderly benefits\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nEmployment Insurance benefits\n1.1\n1.1\n1.2\nCanada Child Benefit\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\nTotal major transfers to persons\n1.1\n1.3\n1.4\nOther program expenses\n-0.2\n0.0\n-0.5\nPublic debt charges\n0.1\n0.2\n0.6\nTotal expenses\n1.0\n1.5\n1.4\nBudgetary balance\n-5.4\n-5.4\n-5.9\nA 1-percentage-point decrease in real GDP growth proportional across income and expenditure components reduces the budgetary balance by $5.4 billion in the first year, $5.4 billion in the second year, and $5.9 billion in the fourth year (Table A1.15).\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

As the parameters of the personal income tax system are indexed to inflation, the fiscal impact is smaller than under the real GDP shock. For the other sources of tax revenue, the negative impacts are similar under the real and nominal GDP shocks.\nEI premium revenues decrease in response to lower earnings.\nOther revenues decline slightly as lower growth in tax revenue results in slightly lower interest and penalty revenue, and lower prices lead to lower revenues from the sales of goods and services.\nPartly offsetting lower revenues are the declines in the cost of statutory programs that are indexed to CPI inflation, such as elderly benefit payments, which put downward pressure on federal program expenses. In addition, other program expenses are also lower as certain programs are linked directly to growth in nominal GDP, such as Equalization.\nPublic debt charges decline in the first year due to lower costs associated with Real Return Bonds.\nTable A1.17\nEstimated Impact of a Sustained 100-Basis-Point Increase in All Interest Rates on Federal Revenues, Expenses and Budgetary Balance\nbillions of dollars\nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 4\nFederal revenues\n2.5\n3.8\n6.0\nFederal expenses\n7.5\n10.1\n13.8\nBudgetary balance\n-4.9\n-6.3\n-7.9\nA 1 per cent increase in interest rates decreases the budgetary balance by $4.9 billion in the first year, $6.3 billion in the second year, and $7.9 billion in the fourth year (Table A1.17). Higher interest rates directly impact estimated public debt charges on marketable debt in two ways. First, interest costs increase as existing debt matures and is refinanced at higher rates. Second, rising rates increase the expected cost of future borrowing needs. Public debt charges are estimated based on the current expectations for future changes in interest rates, which are subject to change based on economic conditions.\nIt is important to note that interest rates also directly affect other government revenues and expenses and that they typically do not change in isolation. That is, with higher interest rates, the government would realise some offsetting benefits, including:\nHigher revenues from the government's interest-bearing assets, and interest and penalty revenue on tax debt, which are recorded as part of other revenues;\nCorresponding downward adjustments that reduce the valuations of public sector pensions and employee benefits obligations, which are not incorporated in the table above; and,\n\nFonte: https://budget.canada.ca/2025/report-rapport/anx1-en.html"}]}

Introduction\nThis guideline applies to federally regulated insurers (FRIs)\nFootnote\n1\nusing International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 17 Insurance Contracts.\nThe\nInsurance Companies Act\nstipulates that institutions' \"financial statements shall, except as otherwise specified by the Superintendent, be prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the primary source of which is the Handbook of the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada).\"\nFootnote\n2\nExpectations set out in this guideline should not impair an institution's ability to obtain an audit opinion that states that the financial statements are in accordance with GAAP, which for institutions is effectively International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB.\nCanadian legislation governing institutions and OSFI's mandate promote boards and management of institutions to adopt policies and procedures designed to control and manage risk. OSFI may specify additional accounting and disclosure expectations. It may also direct institutions to use a specific option within an applicable accounting standard. OSFI makes these specifications in situations where there is a prudential need for additional accounting guidance. In addition to this guideline, OSFI may also provide IFRS 17 measurement guidance in the OSFI Memorandum to the Appointed Actuary, which is updated from time to time. OSFI also expects institutions to be aligned with this measurement guidance.\nOSFI is clarifying its IFRS 17 expectations regarding:\nAccounting for financial guarantee contracts for mortgage insurers;\nIntra-group pooling insurance risk sharing arrangements; and\nCaptive fronting arrangements\nA. Accounting for Financial Guarantee Contracts for Mortgage Insurers\nIFRS 17 provides mortgage insurers the option to classify financial guarantee contracts as either IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts or IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. For consistency and comparability across the industry, mortgage insurers should classify and account for these contracts as insurance contracts and apply IFRS 17.\nOSFI will communicate reporting expectations during the application process for future new entrants.\nB. Intra-Group Pooling Insurance Risk Sharing Arrangements\nThese pooling arrangements are insurance risk sharing arrangements that redistribute risks between affiliates within a group of companies.\nAn important benefit of IFRS 17 is the disaggregation of transactions and the improvement in transparency of reporting. OSFI supports this objective. Accounting for intra-group arrangements should not be conducted on a net basis. Accounting on a net-basis conflicts with the objective of increased transparency.\nWhere an intra-group pooling arrangement constitutes a reinsurance arrangement then IFRS 17 reinsurance contract accounting should be applied as a direct insurance contract for the assuming party and reinsurance contract held for the ceding party. This permits OSFI to assess risks and capital at each individual entity level. It provides more clarity and certainty over priority of claims in the event of insolvency and provides for comparable and consistent reporting of reinsurance contracts across institutions.\nC. Captive Fronting Arrangements\nThese arrangements are insurance contracts entered into with a policyholder and subsequently reinsured to an entity within the same group as the policyholder.\nIrrespective of whether the captive fronting arrangement is classified and accounted for as an insurance contract under IFRS 17 or IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, OSFI expects the FRI to act as principal in its activities with the policyholder and adhere to the OSFI guidance found in Sound Reinsurance Practices and Procedures - Guideline B-3 (2025)\nFootnote\n3\n.\nIf IFRS 17 is applicable, the institution is expected to fully account for these contracts as insurance contracts and disclose all reinsurance contracts held with unregistered reinsurers in the OSFI Regulatory Returns. If the insurer concludes that an accounting treatment other than IFRS 17 is appropriate for a particular captive fronting arrangement, the institution is expected to immediately notify their lead supervisor.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\n\nFonte: https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/en/guidance/guidance-library/ifrs-17-insurance-contracts-guideline"}]}

The\nASPI\nis an indicator of economic activity in the accounting services industry, as well as a tool for the industry for performance evaluation, cost monitoring, contract assessment and benchmark comparisons. In addition, the\nASPI\nis used by the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts to arrive at estimates of real value added for the industry and to measure changes in productivity.\nThe Accounting, tax preparation, bookkeeping, and payroll services industry, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 5412, includes establishments that provide services in: auditing accounting records, designing accounting systems, preparing financial statements, developing budgets, preparing tax returns, processing payrolls, bookkeeping and billing.\nFor the purposes of the\nASPI\n, services are classified into one of five classes:\nClass A: Audit, review and related services;\nClass B: Other assurance services;\nClass C: Bookkeeping, compilation, payroll and general accounting services;\nClass D: Tax preparation services for corporate clients;\nClass E: Tax preparation services for individuals and unincorporated businesses.\nThe\nASPI\nis an aggregation of these five service classes. Data for each service class are collected separately in a questionnaire. An aggregation for Class A and Class B is created by pooling data for both classes (for each establishment separately). This is done as other assurance services (Class B) align best and are most similar to Audit, review and related services (Class A).\nDescription of Figure 1\nThis diagram shows the aggregation structure for the\nASPI\n. The highest level of aggregation is the total\nASPI\n. Below the total\nASPI\nare four service class indexes created from five service classes. Service classes A and B aggregate together to form the first service class index which then aggregates with service class indexes for each of classes C, D and E to form the total\nASPI\n.\nData collection for the previous fiscal year starts in June and finishes in November. While data is collected from respondents according to the fiscal year, for ease of understanding, the index is published annually in December for the prior calendar year.\nPrices for services are determined either through time based rates or flat fees. Time based rates are calculated using the amount of time and the hourly, or daily, billing rate charged to the client for each level of professional working on a particular engagement. Flat fees, also called contingency or commission fees, are lump sums proportional to the size of the engagement or the outcome of the service provided. The\nASPI\nattempts to use the time-based rate but can accommodate the less common flat fee rate when required.\nTo be able to measure the year-to-year percentage change in the prices of various service classes, respondents are asked to provide the total price charged to a particular client (net of indirect taxes) for a specific accounting contract provided in two consecutive years.\nAppendix A defines key concepts used for constructing the\nASPI\n.\n2 Data Sources\n2.1 Sampling process\nThe sample is drawn from the frame of all establishments classified to\nNAICS\n5412. The probability of selection is based on the Sequential Poisson Probability Proportional to Size\nNote\nsampling methodology.\nThe sample was last updated in 2022 using Business Register data for 2021. The targeted sample size of 600 establishments was chosen to obtain a sufficient number of price quotes to represent the industry.\n2.2 Prices\nData for the\nASPI\nare collected from a yearly survey of establishments who provide accounting services during the year in which the sample was selected.\nRespondents are asked to report prices for contracts that are representative of the type of services they offer and which represent a substantial percentage of their establishment's annual revenue. They are asked to report prices for contracts that are likely to be renewed in the years following the initial survey.\nFor the purposes of measuring price change, the unit of measure may consist of either an entire contract or a portion of a contract. Since prices will generally be based on a model or estimate rather than actual recurring transactions, service substitutions will be limited.\n\nFonte: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/62f0014m/62f0014m2025007-eng.htm"}]}

In the event that the original model contract becomes obsolete, the firm may specify a new one. While adjustments can be made from time to time, the model is intended to remain static as long as it remains representative of the typical work in which the firm engages. By holding the characteristics of the model contract constant, this approach allows a constant-quality service price to be calculated. This constant quality price then feeds into the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts' estimates of constant dollar\nGDP\n.\n2.3 Annual revision\nThe\nASPI\nis not subject to revision.\n2.4 Weights\nThe annual weights used are a combination of the revenue data stored on the Business Register and the breakdown of the establishments' revenue according to the different classes of services offered. The revenue breakdown is reported as a percentage of the establishment's total revenue allocated to each service class. These percentages are then applied to the data obtained from the Business Register to derive a value for each service class by establishment. It is assumed that these derived revenues best reflect, in the aggregate, the relative importance over time of the service classes in the accounting industry.\n3 Index Estimation and Aggregation\n3.1 Introduction\nThe\nASPI\nis based on a matched sample, where the same services are compared in consecutive periods. The\nASPI\nis calculated for the current period and compared to the previous period to measure price change.

The revenue weights assigned to each establishment at the time of selection remain fixed between basket updates. For the\nASPI\n, this occurs every five years. Basket updates include adjusting revenue weights and updating the sample by adding or removing establishments to ensure that the target population is accurately represented by the index. Prices collected from the new sample will form a new index series using the revised weights.\nPartial weight updates occur every two years using new information provided by respondents to modify the shares of revenue by service class for each establishment.

The Complaint [1] This is a decision respecting a Complaint signed by Joyce Beattie (hereinafter referred to as the \"Complainant\") on January 18, 2011 and received by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (hereinafter referred to as the \"Commission\") on January 19, 2011. The Complaint was amended on December 8, 2011.\n[2] The Complainant alleges in her Complaint that Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (now known as Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada and hereinafter referred to as the \"Respondent\") discriminated against her \"...in the provision of a service customarily available to the general public and which s. 5(3) and s. 9(3) of the Indian Act require the Respondent to provide to \"any person\". In particular, the Respondent summarily refused, based entirely on the prohibited ground of family status discrimination, to give proper and adequate consideration to the facts and law presented to him to establish the Complainant's entitlement to Indian registration and band membership pursuant to ss. 6(1)(c) and 11(1)(c) of the Indian Act. The purpose of the complaint is to prevent a continuing contravention of the Canadian Human Rights Act by the Respondent in the conduct of his statutory duties pertaining to the Complainant's request of June 2, 2010 for corrective amendment to her Indian registration and band membership.\" The Complainant further alleges in the Complaint that \"...documents and a request for amendment to her registration category to 6(1)(c), which would entitle her to reinstatement in her former and proper Gwichya Gwich'in Band, were delivered to the Indian Registrar on June 7, 2010. By letter dated December 7, 2010, the Indian Registrar summarily rejected the Complainant's request...\"\n[3] The Complaint cites section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (hereinafter referred to as the \"CHRA\") as the discriminatory practice(s) alleged to have occurred on the prohibited grounds of marital status and family status under section 3 of the CHRA. The two above mentioned sections of the CHRA read as follows;\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

Facts [6] In December of 1949, the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 98, included the following provisions:\n2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires...\n(b) \"band\" means any tribe, band or body of Indians who own or are interested in a reserve or in Indian lands in common, of which the legal status is vested in the Crown, or who share alike in the distribution of any annuities or interest moneys for which the Government of Canada is responsible; and, when action is being take by the band as such, means the band in council; ...\n(d) \"Indian\" means\n(i) any male person of Indian blood reputed to belong to a particular band;\n(ii) any child of such person; or\n(iii) any woman who is or was lawfully married to such person;...\n(g) irregular band means any tribe, band or body of persons of Indian blood who own no interest in any reserve or lands of which the legal title is vested in the Crown, who possess no common fund managed by the Government of Canada, and who have not had any treaty relations with the Crown, ...\n(h) \"non-treaty Indian\" mans any person of Indian blood who is reputed to belong to an irregular band or who follows the Indian mode of life, each of such person is only a temporary resident in Canada;...\n[7] The Complainant was born on December 4, 1949, in the community known as Tsiigehtchic, Northwest Territories (formerly known as Arctic Red River). Her biological parents were James Delap Harris and Roselia (or Roaslie) Harris (nee Arruka or Aruke).\n[8] James Delap Harris and Roselia (or Rosalie) Harris (nee Arruka or Aruke) married in or around 1938.\n[9] On or about December 8, 1949, Norbert Otto Natsie and Bernadette Natsie (nee Coyen) adopted Joyce Beattie at the age of four days old in accordance with Aboriginal custom, as her natural mother could not care for her on account of illness.\n[10] At the time they custom adopted the Complainant, Norbert Otto Natsie and Bernadette Natsie (nee Coyen) were Indians pursuant to the provisions of the Indian Act then in force and their names appeared on the Treaty 11 annuity pay list for what was then known as the Loucheaux No. 6 Band. The Respondent now recognizes the Gwichya Gwich'in band as the contemporary name of the Loucheaux No. 6 Band.\n[11] The Complainant's name was not added to the Treaty 11 annuity pay list for what was then known as the Loucheaux No. 6 Band at the time of the custom adoption.\n[12] The Indian Act was substantially amended effective September 4, 1951. The Indian Act, S.C. 1951, c. 29, included the following provisions:\n2. (1) In this Act, ...\n(b) \"child\" includes a legally adopted Indian child;...\n(g) \"Indian\" means a person who pursuant to this Act is registered as an Indian or is entitled to be registered as an Indian;...\n(j) \"member of a band\" means a person whose name appears on a Band List or who is entitled to have his name appear on a Band List;...\n11. Subject to section twelve, a person is entitled to be registered if that person...\n(b) is a member of a band\n(i) for whose use and benefit, in common, lands have been set apart or since the twenty-sixth day of May, eighteen hundred and seventy four have been agreed by treaty to be set apart, or\n(ii) that has been declared by the Governor in Council to be a band for the purposes of this Act,\n...\n(d) is the legitimate child of\n(i) a male person described in paragraph (a) or (b).\n...\n14. A woman who is a member of a band ceases to be a member of that band if she marries a person who is not a member of that ban, but if she marries a member of another band, she thereupon becomes a member of the band of which her husband is a member.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

As of the coming into force of the 1951 amendments, the band lists then in existence were to constitute the Indian Register, and a General List was created for persons who were entitled to registration but had no band membership.\n[14] On April 6, 1974, the Complainant married Bruce Beattie, who was not registered or eligible for registration under the Indian Act. As a result of this marriage, Ms. Beattie lost any entitlements she may have had to registration and band membership, under the \"marrying out\" provisions of the Indian Act in force at the time. Those provisions applied only to Indian women, and not to Indian men.\n[15] On March 17, 1975, the Complainant and Bruce Beattie had a son, T'Seluq Beattie.\n[16] On June 1, 1976, the Complainant and Bruce Beattie had a daughter, Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie).\n[17] Effective April 17, 1985, the Indian Act was substantially amended by Bill C-31: An Act to Amend the Indian Act. As amended, the Indian Act included the following provisions:\n2. (1) In this Act,...\n\"child\" includes a legally adopted child and a child adopted in accordance with Indian custom;...\n\"Indian\" means a person who pursuant to this Act is registered or is entitled to be registered as an India;...\n\"member of a band\" means a person whose name appears on a Band List or who is entitled to have his name appear on a Band List; ...\n5. (5) The name of a person who is entitled to be registered is not required to be recorded in the Indian Register unless an application for registration is made to the Registrar.\n11. (1) Commencing on April 17, 1985, a person is entitled to have his name entered in a Band List maintained in the Department for a band if...\n(c) that person is entitled to be registered under paragraph 6(1)(c) and ceased to be a member of that band by reason of the circumstances set out in that paragraph;...\n[18] Since the Bill C-31 amendments, it has been ss. 6(1) and 6(2) of the Indian Act that describe the various persons who are entitled to be registered in the Indian Register. As they stood immediately after the Bill C-31 amendments:\n1. s. 6(1) set out categories of eligible persons that include the following:\nall persons who were registered or entitled immediately prior to the effective date of the 1985 amendments (s. 6(1)(c)); and\nwomen whose names were deleted or omitted from band lists (before September 4, 1951), or from the Indian Register (September 4, 1951 and after) because they married non-Indian men (s. 6(1)(c)); and\npersons who have two Indian parents (s. 6(1)(f); and\n2. s. 6(2) created eligibility for persons who have one Indian parent.\n[19] Persons who are registered or eligible for registration under s. 6(1) of the Indian Act are able to pass entitlement to registration to the children they have with persons who are not registered or eligible for registration under the Indian Act. Persons who are registered or eligible for registration under s. 6(2) of the Indian Act are not able to pass entitlement to registration to the children they have with persons who are not registered or eligible for registration under the Indian Act.\n[20] The Bill C-31 amendments allowed a band to assume control of its own membership, and maintain its own Band List, subject to certain requirements (Indian Act, s. 10). Until such time as a band assumes control of its Band List, the Band List continues to be maintained in the Department by the Indian Registrar, who can add or delete the names of persons who are entitled or not entitled, in accordance with the Act (Indian Act, s. 9). The Indian Registrar is not required to add a name to a band list unless an application for entry therein is made to the Indian Registrar (Indian Act, s 9(5)).\n[21] The Bill C-31 amendments to the Indian Act changed the registration entitlements of the Complainant's biological parents. As a result of the amendments, (i) James Delap Harris became eligible for registration under s. 6(2) and (ii) Roselia (or Rosalie) Harris (nee Arruka or Aruke) became eligible for registration under s. 6(1)(c).\n[22] On or around September 1, 1985, the Complainant sent an application to the Office of the Indian Registrar, asking that she and her children be registered under the Indian Act.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

It also registered her children under s. 6(2), based on the fact they had one registered parent (the Complainant) and one parent who was not registered or entitled (Mr. Beattie). The Respondent later added the names of the Complainant and her children to the Band List for the Fort Good Hope band (i.e., the band of the Complainant's biological mother), after the Fort Good Hope band decided not to enact its own membership rules.\n[24] By letter dated March 10, 1986, the Indian Registrar wrote to the Complainant to advise that she and her children were registered under the Indian Act. The letter also explained that (i) if the Fort Good Hope Band decided before June 28, 1987, to assume control of its own Band List, she would have to apply to the Fort Good Hope Band for membership and her children's membership, and (ii) if the Fort Good Hope Band did not assume control of its Band List by June 28, 1987, the Complainant and her children would be eligible for membership in the Fort Good Hope Band, pursuant to s. 11(2)(b) of the Indian Act.\n[25] The Fort Good Hope Band did not assume control of its own Band List by June 28, 1987. As a result, the Indian Registrar added the Complainant, T'Seluq Beattie and Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie) to the Band List for the Fort Good Hope Band effective June 28, 1987.\n[26] On March 3, 2010, the Gender Equity in Indian Registration Act (\"GEIRA\") was introduced to Parliament and given first reading. Among other things, GEIRA added a new s. 6(1)(c.1) to the Indian Act, which grants registration entitlement to the child of a marriage between a man who is not registered or eligible for registration, and a woman described in s. 6(1)(c) whose name was, because of the marriage, removed from a band list (before September 4, 1951) or the Indian Register (September 4, 1951, and after), where (i) the child was born after the date of the marriage, and (ii) the child has himself or herself had or adopted a child with a person who is not registered or eligible for registration on or after September 4, 1951. GEIRA passed third reading in the House of Commons on November 22, 2010, and third reading in the Senate on December 9, 2010. Royal assent was given December 15, 2010, and GEIRA came into force on January 31, 2011.\n[27] By letter dated April 22, 1993, the Respondent's then Deputy Minister formally acknowledged the following, in accordance with a settlement reached with the Crown concerning treaty annuities:\n\"Joyce Wilma Beattie, Nikota Beattie and T'Seluq Beattie's Treaty 11 entitlements are not linked to status but may be linked to other factors, one of which is ancestry. In the case of Joyce Wilma Beattie, Nikota Beattie and T'Seluq Beattie, the annuity entitlements pursuant to Treaty Eleven accrued at birth and thereafter have continued to exist, and are treaty entitlements that have been recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\"\n[28] In a letter to the Office of the Indian Registrar dated June 2, 2010, the Complainant for the first time advised the Respondent of her custom adoption for which she had obtained a certificate of custom adoption from the Northwest Territories Supreme Court recognizing that she was custom adopted legally effective on December 8, 1949. She asked that (i) her category of registration be amended from s. 6(1)(f) to s. 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act, based on her custom adoption, and (ii) her band membership to be changed from the band with which her biological mother was affiliated (752 Good Hope), to that with which her adoptive parents were affiliated (753 Gwichya Gwich'in).\n[29] In a letter to the complainant dated December 7, 2010, the Indian Registrar stated that, among other things, (i) the Complainant's custom adoption would not entitle her to be registered under s. 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act, (ii)\"...for your information, the registration categories of an adoptee, adopted by two Indian parents is under the provisions of subsection 6(1)(f) of the Indian Act and the registration category a adoptee (sic) adopted by one Indian parent is under the provisions of subsection 6(2) of the Indian Act\", and (iii) if the Complainant wished to transfer to the band of her custom adoptive parents, she would have to contact INAC's regional office in the Northwest Territories to request an official band transfer.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

By letter dated February 7, 2012, the Indian Registrar advised that because T'Seluq Beattie was registered under s. 6(2) of the Indian Act, and Stephanie Beattie could not be identified as someone registered or eligible to be registered, he could not determine that Theron Beattie was entitled to be registered.\n[33] Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie) has had two children with Reynold Bangloy (who is not registered or eligible for registration under the Indian Act): Jreyden Bangloy, born December 18, 2003; and Brodin Bangloy, born March 26, 2005.\n[34] Nikota Bangloy submitted applications for registration dated March 11, 2011, on behalf of her children, Jreyden and Brodin Bangloy. By letter dated February 7, 2012, the Indian Registrar advised that because Nikota Bangloy was registered under s. 6(2) of the Indian Act, and Reynold Bangloy could not be identified as someone registered or eligible to be registered, he could not determine that Brodin Bangloy was entitled to registration. On February 23, 2012, the Indian Registrar sent a letter to the same effect concerning Jreyden Bangloy.\n[35] By letter dated December 9, 2012 counsel for the Respondent wrote to advise that the Respondent had changed its approach and was now prepared to recognize that the Complainant had an entitlement to register under s. 6(1)(c). This reversal was made possible because the Respondent had changed its interpretation of the term \"child\" as used in the 1927 Indian Act. Up to this point, the Respondent had interpreted that term as including only biological children of a male Indian. As Ms. McLenachan the witness for the Respondent testified, the Respondent now decided to look at the term \"with a different lens\", expanding its definition of the term to include custom adopted children. The consequences were as follows:\n* The Complainant became an \"Indian\" on December 8, 1949, as the child of a male Indian (her custom adoptive father);\n* The Complainant was entitled to register as an Indian under the 1951 Indian Act;\n* The Complainant lost her entitlement to register when she married Bruce Beattie in 1974;\n* The Complainant was thus a woman who had lost an entitlement before April 17, 1985, due to marrying-out, and therefore met the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) as of that date;\n* her children, T'Seluq Beattie and Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie), were entitled to registration under s. 6(1)(c.1) rather than s. 6(2).\n* her grandchildren, Jreyden and Brodin Bangloy, and Theron Beattie, were entitled to registration for the first time under s. 6(2) because their parents became entitled to registration under s. 6(1) (c.1);\n* The Complainant and her children retained their existing memberships in the Fort Good Hope Band; and\n* The Complainant and her children could apply to transfer their memberships to another band of their choosing, pursuant to s. 12 of the Indian Act.\n[36] On January 3, 2013, the Complainant received a letter from the Indian Registrar advising that, among other things, (i) upon further review her entitlement to registration has been amended from s. 6(1)(f) to s. 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act, and (ii) she retained her membership in the Fort Good Hope Band, now under s. 11(1)(c) of the Indian Act.\n[37] On or around January 3 or 4, 2013, the Indian Registrar amended the registration categories of T'Seluq Beattie and Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie) so that they are now registered under s. 6(1)(c.1) of the Indian Act, rather than s. 6(2).\n[38] On January 4, 2013, the Indian Registrar (i) registered Theron Beattie, and Brodin and Jreyden Bangloy, under s. 6(2) of the Indian Act, and (ii) and added the names of Theron Beattie, and Brodin and Jreyden Bangloy, to the Band List of the Fort Good Hope Band under s. 11(2)(b) of the Indian Act.\n[39] In a letter to the Indian Registration Administrator of the Fort Good Hope Band dated January 4, 2013, the Indian Registrar provided the following rationale for registering Theron Beattie under s. 6(2) of the Indian Act:\nRationale:\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

His mother, JOYCE WILMA BEATTIE nee HARRIS, born on 1949/12/04, registered under section 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act under Register No.7520073601. Amended from 6(1)(f) to paragraph 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act on 2013/01/03. Original entitlement based on paragraph 2(d)(ii) of the Indian Act , R.S.C. 1927, c. 98 which reads that \"any child\" of a male person is entitled to registration. Therefore, as a child who was custom adopted on 1949/12/08, by a registered Indian she would have been entitled to registration at the time of the adoption. She married BRUCE ALLAN BEATTIE, a non-Indian, on 1974/04/06.\n[40] Although the Complainant's registration request had now been addressed, the Respondent continued to refuse to change her statutory band membership. The parties exchanged further particulars dealing with that issue. In its Amended Statement of Particulars the Respondent acknowledged that the Complainant was entitled to have her name added to the Gwichya Gwich'in Band List, but said it could not implement that change because her name was already on the Band List for the Fort Good Hope band, and the only way she could move her name to Gwichya Gwich'in would be \"...by transferring her membership pursuant to paragraph 12(b) of the Indian Act\".\n[41] In letters to the Respondent's counsel dated March 27 and April 18, 2013, the Complainant's representative requested that the Respondent delete the names of the Complainant, Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie), T'Seluq Beattie, Jreyden Bangloy, Brodin Bangloy and Theron Beattie from the Fort Good Hope Band List.\n[42] By letter to the Complainant's representative dated April 29, 2013, the Acting Indian Registrar advised that, among other things, (i) the names of the Complainant, Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie), T'Seluq Beattie, Jreyden Bangloy and Brodin Bangloy had been removed from the Fort Good Hope Band list on April 29, 2013, and (ii) the name of Theron Beattie would be removed from the Fort Good Hope Band List on April 30, 2013. In doing so the Respondent changed its previous position about not deleting the Complainant and her descendants from the Band List for Fort Good Hope without a \"transfer\" under s. 12(d) of the Indian Act.\n[43] It is open to the Complainant and her descendants to apply to have their names added to the Gwichya Gwich'in Band List, if they wish. The Complainant has confirmed that she no longer wants this to happen.\nIII. Issues [44] The Complaint gives rise to the following issues:\na) Has the matter been rendered moot by the amendment of the Complainant's category of registration in January of 2013, and by the removal of her name from the Band List for Fort Good Hope in April of 2013?\nb) Have the Complainant and the Commission met their burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of family status and/or sex, contrary to s. 5 of the CHRA?\nc) If there was prima facie discrimination, has the Respondent met its burden of proving that it had a bona fide justification for its initial refusals to make the requested amendments to the Complainant's category of registration and band membership in June, 2010?\nd) If there was prima facie discrimination that did not have a bona fide justification, what remedies would be appropriate?\nIV. Summary of the Commission's Submissions [45] In her letter dated June 2, 2010, the Complainant asked the Respondent to amend her category of registration from s. 6(1)(f) to s. 6(1)(c), based on her custom adoption, and to remove her name from the Band List for Fort Good Hope Band and add it to the Band List for the band of her adoptive parents the Arctic Red River Band (753 Gwichya Gwich'in NT). At issue is whether, in responding to those requests the Respondent was engaged in the provision of \"services customarily available to the general public\", within meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA.\n[46] \"Services\" within the meaning of s. 5 contemplates something of benefit being held out as a service and offered to the public, in the context of a public relationship. Because government actions are generally taken for the benefit of the public, the \"customarily available to the general public\" requirement in s. 5 will usually be present in cases relating to government conduct.\n[47] Granting the Complainant's requests would have led to the conferral of benefits that were not otherwise available.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

Canada Revenue Agency, 2012 FCA 7 (\"Murphy\"); Matson et al. v. Indian & Northern Affairs Canada (now Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada), 2013 CHRT 13 (\"Matson\"); and Andrews et al. v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2013 CHRT 21 (\"Andrews\"), this is a case where the Respondent had discretion in its processing of the Complainant's request in interpreting the definition of \"child\" in the 1927 Indian Act. In initially choosing a narrower definition of the 1927 Indian Act that excluded custom adopted children, the Respondent was exercising discretion in the course of processing the application rather than applying mandatory legislative wording. Its choices in that regard are properly reviewable under s. 5 of the CHRA, as matters relating to the provision of services customarily available to the general public.\n[50] During the period between the initial request (June 2, 2010) and the eventual amendment of registration category (confirmed January 3, 2013), the Respondent denied the service sought by the Complainant - namely, a proper non-discriminatory assessment of her entitlement to registration under s. 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act. This was a denial of a service within the meaning of s. 5(a) of the CHRA. In the alternative, during that same period, the Respondent adversely differentiated against the Complainant in the provision of a service. Specifically, in assessing her entitlement to registration under s. 6(1)(c) during this time, the Respondent chose to draw distinctions between biological children and custom adopted children. This was adverse differentiation within the meaning of s. 5(b) of the CHRA.\n[51] The Respondent maintained its refusal of the Complainant's request with respect to registration for at least two years after GEIRA came into force on January 31, 2011. The refusal to amend her registration category had negative impacts on the Complainant's ability to transmit status entitlements to her descendants throughout this time period and ensuring government records properly reflected her custom adoption recognizing the correct parent-child relationship.\n[52] In this case, the Respondent has acknowledged that the initial barrier to granting the request to amend registration category was that the Complainant was a custom adoptee, and as such was not treated as the \"child\" of her adoptive father under the 1927 Indian Act, and could only be registered under s. 6(1)(f) or 6(2). In this sense, the Respondent's denial or adverse differentiation was based on the Complainant's status as a custom adoptee - a matter that is captured under the prohibited ground of \"family status\" under the CHRA.\n[53] In refusing to give legal effect to the custom adoption within the context of the registration scheme, the Respondent effectively excluded the Complainant for nearly two and a half years from accessing the category of 6 (1)(c) registration, which had been introduced in 1985 to partially remedy the historic sex discrimination in the marrying-out provisions of the Indian Act. In this sense, the discriminatory practice identified by the Commission, while rooted in issues of family status, also had an intersecting adverse impact based on the Complainant's identity as an aboriginal woman.\n[54] The Respondent's changes in its position on registration and band membership of the Complainant is effectively an admission that the previous exclusionary approach was not \"reasonably necessary\" within the meaning of the applicable jurisprudence, and that the previous approach therefore did not have a bona fide justification within the meaning of the CHRA and applicable case law.\n[55] The Complaint should not be dismissed for mootness as there are still live remedial claims since the revisions by the Respondent to its position vis a vis registration and band membership. In order to adjudicate its merits, the Tribunal must, among other things, determine whether the Respondent has or has not engaged in discriminatory practice.\n[56] The Tribunal should order under s. 53(2)(a) that the Respondent take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to prevent the same or similar discriminatory practices from occurring in the future.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

Summary of the Complainant's Submissions [57] The Complainant agrees with and adopts the Commission's submissions.\n[58] The Complainant argues that she and her descendants have been denied the administrative services mandated by Treaty 11, in particular, proper treaty band membership, annuity payment and education funding and record keeping.\n[59] By amendment of the Indian Act entitlement rules in 1985 (Bill C-31), registration is no longer linked to statutory band membership and can have no effect on any existing treaty band membership. As a result, Indian Act registration has had no relevance or effect on treaty entitlement since 1982 as a result of the enactment of the Constitution Act, and at least since 1985, treaty annuity paylists are not the same as statutory Band Lists and do not determine statutory band membership. Legal entitlement to band membership is based on different personal qualifications. Treaty band membership is constitutional and based exclusively on natural descent from an original treaty adherent and current family status. Statutory band membership is not constitutional and is based exclusively on either s. 11 rules or s. 10 delegated band determined rules under the Indian Act, neither of which necessarily require natural descent or any particular family status.\n[60] With the repeal of s. 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act in 2008, extended in 2011 to \"...complaints against a First Nations government, including a band council, tribal council or governing authority operating or administering programs and services under the Indian Act, .\" all of the Indian Registry administrative services, including both regular statutory registration as well as verification of the relevant facts of individual treaty entitlement and treaty band affiliation, are now subject to both human rights principles and constitutional protection of all existing aboriginal, treaty or land claim rights. The constitutional obligation to give primacy to existing aboriginal and treaty rights when applying human rights principles to the Indian Act is confirmed as follows:\n1.1 For greater certainty, the repeal of section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act shall not be construed so as to abrogate or derogate from the protection provided for existing aboriginal or treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada by the recognition and affirmation of those rights in section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n[61] In accordance with the terms of Treaty 11, the Complainant, her two children and her three grandchildren are all Treaty 11 Indians and have been since the time of each of their respective births, because they have all been officially recognized by Canada to be natural descendants of original treaty adherents and have been officially recognized by Canada to be either Treaty 11 adherents or are children of adherents. They are also all members of the Loucheaux Indians No. 6 Treaty 11 Band of Arctic Red River, because that is the treaty band that Canada has recognized the Complainant to have been a member of as a result of her aboriginal custom adoption and her natural descendants are entitled to be members of that same treaty band which still exists on treaty annuity paylists. All of which has been guaranteed to each of them by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 since April 17, 1982.\n[62] Treaty 11 Indian adherents are also constitutionally entitled to be correctly identified in all of Canada's administrative records including treaty annuity paylists and the Indian Register.\n[63] After the first annuity payment to any Treaty 11 adherent, records of all subsequent annual payments are maintained as perpetual service provided by the Respondent with no adhesion re-qualification ever required and all family status or band affiliation changes are simply noted on the paylists at the time of each annual payment.\n[64] Up to and including the year 2011, the Respondent has provided necessary Treaty 11 administrative services and paid treaty annuity to the Complainant and each of her children for every year of their lives from their respective births. The Complainant and her children have been thereby officially recognized as Treaty 11 adherents and paid treaty annuities based on nothing more than their birth records showing that they are natural descendants of original 1921 Treaty 11 adherents. Official birth records, where they even exist, are all that any descendent Treaty 11 adherent since 1921 has ever been required to provide proof of their treaty entitlement and to be included on the Treaty 11 annuity pay list for the treaty band of their family ancestors.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

The Respondent refused to pay any annuity for any of the Complainant's grandchildren on the grounds that they were not registered under the Indian Act.\n[66] The Complainant argues that the decisions made in 2011 by the Respondent's regional treaty administration official effectively denied goods (treaty annuity) and services (inclusion on annuity pay list), which are the only services offered by the Respondent to facilitate Treaty 11 adhesion, and the denial was based on the irrelevant fact of the grandchildren's Indian Act status as \"non-registered\" children and were thereby arbitrarily deemed not to be descendants of original Treaty 11 adherents. The Complainant argues those administrative decisions have no justification under either the terms of Treaty 11 or any provision of the Indian Act, and are therefore infringement of constitutionally guaranteed Treaty 11 rights.\n[67] Pursuant to s. 53(2)(b) of the CHRA, the Complainant seeks a declaration that the Complainant, her two children and her three grandchildren have all been Treaty 11 Indians from their respective births and are therefore personally entitled to the existing rights, benefits and privileges constitutionally guaranteed to Treaty 11 Indians, including membership in the Complainant's originally named Loucheaux Indians No.6 Treaty 11 Band of Arctic Red River, and to be officially recorded as such on the treaty annuity paylists for that Treaty 11 band.\n[68] Pursuant to s. 53(2)(c) and (d) of the CHRA, the Complainant claims, for the benefit of her three grandchildren, immediate payment by the Respondent of Treaty 11 annuity arrears for each year of each of their respective lives and reimbursement of all tuition expenses incurred to date to obtain the educational instruction of those grandchildren which the Respondent promised to pay under the terms of Treaty 11 but have withheld pending the outcome of this Complaint.\n[69] As the victims of willful and reckless conduct, the Complainant claims that she, her two children and three grandchildren are each entitled to claim additional compensation from the Respondent under s. (3) of the CHRA.\nVI. Summary of the Respondent's Submissions [70] There is no longer a live controversy between the parties relating to the Complainant's registration entitlement as a result of the Respondent's reversal of its position on December 9, 2013 and, as such, this issue is moot.\n[71] There is no longer a live controversy between the parties in relation to statutory band membership as a result of the Respondent's reversal of its position on deletion of her and her descendants' names from the Fort Good Hope Band List on April 29, 2013 and because the Complainant has withdrawn her request to have her name added to the Gwichya Gwich'in Band List and, as such, this issue is also moot.\n[72] The Complaint is a challenge to legislation, and nothing else, just as in Matson. The Complaint addresses interpreting s. 6 of the Indian Act, and interpreting the term \"child\" in the 1927 Indian Act.\n[73] The Registrar interpreted the word \"child\" in order to apply s. 6 to determine correctly the Complainant's registration category as an Indian and in so doing, exercised no discretion. When the Registrar subsequently reviewed and changed its interpretation, it also did not exercise discretion (s. 6 affords no discretion regarding the treatment of custom adoptees), but rather corrected an erroneous interpretation of the statute.\n[74] The Complainant takes issue, not with the manner in which her application for registration was processed, but rather with the Registrar's statutory interpretation of the word \"child\" and the eligibility rules prescribed in s. 6 of the Indian Act. These criteria, prescribed by Parliament, which has jurisdiction to so under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, cannot reasonably be termed a \"service\". Parliamentary law making is not a service.\n[75] The term \"service\" does not contemplate Parliament's definition of \"Indian\" under the Indian Act. A number of specific features militate against such a construal of \"service\": the reasonable accommodation requirement, the concept of undue hardship, and the factors of \"health, safety and cost\" which inform the bona fide justification analysis. Consideration of these elements demonstrates that a challenge to legislation, as in this Complaint, cannot be appropriately assessed by these mechanisms.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

In the event that the Complaint is not found to be moot, and is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the Respondent argues that its actions were not discriminatory.\n[77] While the Respondent acknowledges that the tests for discrimination by Charter cases and human rights cases may differ, the definition of discrimination used by the Supreme Court of Canada in Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia [1989] 1 SCR 143, has been applied by the Federal Court in relation to the CHRA. In Andrews, Justice McIntyre wrote:\nI would say then that discrimination may be described as a distinction, whether intentional or not but based on grounds relating to personal characteristics of the individual or group, which has the effect of imposing burdens, obligations, or disadvantages on such individual or group not imposed upon others, or which withholds or limits access to opportunities, benefits, and advantages available to other members of society.\n[78] The denial of the Complainant's request to have her registration entitlement changed from being pursuant to s. 6(1)(f) to s. 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act did not impose \"burdens, obligations or disadvantages...not imposed upon others\" nor did it \"limit access to opportunities, benefits and advantages available to other members of society\" at the time of her demand nor at the time of the Respondent's response.\n[79] The only objective difference between the registration entitlement and band membership that Complainant had and the registration entitlement and band membership that she sought, is that with the remedial revisions to the Indian Act made through GEIRA, which took effect January 31, 2011, registration pursuant to s. 6(1)(c), would enable the Complainant to transmit registration entitlement to her grandsons. Prior to that there was no difference vis a vis transmission of status between ss. 6(1)(f) and 6(1)(c). Regardless of her registration status, the grandsons could not have been registered as Indians, pursuant to the Indian Act, prior to January 31, 2011. Furthermore, by virtue of s. 11 of the Indian Act they could not have their names added to the Band List of the Fort Good Hope Band or the Gwichya Gwich'in Band.\n[80] The Respondent argues that issues relating to the Complainant's constitutionally guaranteed aboriginal and treaty rights are not within the scope of this Complaint, which relates to registration and band membership pursuant to the Indian Act, and have not been proven in any event.\n[81] The scope of the Complaint relates to the Complainant's June 2, 2010 request for changes to her registration status and band membership pursuant to the Indian Act to reflect her custom adoption. For this reason, compensation or allegations of infringement pre-dating the request are beyond the scope of the Complaint.\n[82] Treaty entitlement is tied to band membership in a band that signed or adhered to a treaty. Until the Complainant's grandsons became entitled to band membership in the Fort Good Hope Band or the Gwichya Gwich'in Band, after GEIRA came into effect, they had no treaty entitlement under Treaty 11.\n[83] If the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear this Complaint, and the Complaint is not moot, and the Tribunal finds that the Respondent discriminated against the Complainant, the Respondent argues in the further alternative that its actions were justified as bona fide pursuant to s. 15(1)(g) and 15(2) of the CHRA.\n[84] The Complainant's request for a declaration is beyond the scope of the Complaint and beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to make as it does not fall within the scope of s. 53(2)(c) and (d) of the CHRA. Furthermore, the evidence heard does not establish that the Complainant's grandchildren had treaty entitlement since birth. The evidence shows that the Loucheaux No. 6 Band is the Gwichya Gwich'in Band and that the Respondent has not kept treaty annuity paylists for the Loucheaux No. 6 Band since 1955.\n[85] The Respondent's actions cannot be characterized as intentionally discriminatory or devoid of caution as is required to sustain an Order under section 53(3) of the CHRA. There is no evidence to support the finding that the Respondent \"intended and perhaps wanted to discriminate\" against the Complainant.\n[86] In the event that the alleged discrimination is substantiated and a public interest remedy is ordered, the Respondent requests that the Respondent be given 6 months to create and implement the Directive.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

Analysis A. Has the matter been rendered moot? [87] The fact that after initially refusing to do so the Respondent changed its positions with respect to the Complainant's requests of June 2, 2010 to register her under s. 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act and to remove her name from the Band List for the Fort Good Hope band and add it to the Band List of the Gwichya Gwich'in band, based on her custom adoption, does not, in my opinion, render moot the issue of whether the Respondent's initial refusal, prior to its change of positions, constituted discrimination under s. 5 of the CHRA and, if so, whether and what remedies flow from such discrimination.\n[88] While remedies under s. 53 of the CHRA cannot be imposed unless there is a finding by the Tribunal that a Complaint has been substantiated, the contrary is not true. The Tribunal can find that a Complaint is substantiated without imposing a remedy. If a person voluntarily ceases the conduct that is alleged by a Complainant to be discriminatory prior to a hearing being held into the Complaint, the Complaint can still be found to be substantiated by the Tribunal for the period of time prior to the cessation that the conduct took place, notwithstanding that a remedy may not be imposed. Hence a matter does not become moot simply because the person allegedly carrying on the impugned conduct decides to stop the conduct or because no remedial order might be imposed if the Tribunal makes a finding that the conduct was discriminatory while it was carried on and finds that the Complaint is substantiated.\n[89] In this case, not only is liability still a live issue respecting conduct by the Respondent before it chose to change its positions but the issue of remedies both personal and public interest also remain live despite the change in positions.\n[90] Moreover, as the hearing has been held and the issues fully argued in an adversarial context involving important quasi-constitutional rights, there is no valid argument here in support of saving scarce judicial resources, etc., as per the tests set out for mootness by the case law. (Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), 1989 SCR 342.)\nB. Has discrimination been established? [91] To determine whether the Respondent's conduct during the roughly two and a half year period from the date of the requests to the dates of the change in positions, constituted discrimination under s. 5 of the CHRA, on the basis of family status and sex, as alleged by the Complainant in her Complaint, requires the Complainant initially to establish a prima facie case on the balance of probabilities.\n[92] In order to establish such a case, under s. 5 of the CHRA, it must be proved that:\na) The Respondent was engaged in the provision of \"services customarily available to the general public\", within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA;\nb) the Respondent either denied the service to the complainant, or adversely differentiated against the complainant in the provision of the services; and\nc) the denial or adverse differentiation was based in whole or in part on a prohibited ground of discrimination, and/or had a disproportionate adverse impact on persons identified by a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[93] The threshold for establishing a prima facie case of discrimination is low. A prima facie case is one that covers the allegations made and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant's favour, in the absence of an answer from the Respondent. Once a Complainant establishes a prima facie case, the Complainant is entitled to relief in the absence of some alternate explanation from the Respondent. (First Nations Child and Family Caring Society v. Canada (Attorney General) 2012 FC 445 (\"FNCFCS\".))\n[94] The Supreme Court has held on numerous occasions that human rights legislation has a quasi-constitutional status and is to be given a large, purposive and liberal interpretation to ensure the remedial goals of the legislation are best achieved. A strict grammatical analysis may thus be subordinated to the remedial purposes of the human rights law so as to enhance rather than enfeeble it. (F.N.C.F.S., supra; C.N.R. v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), (1987) S.C.J. No. 42.)\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

However, a service does not have to be available to all members of the general public\" within the meaning of s. 5. It is sufficient if a segment of the public can avail themselves of the service. (Canada (Attorney General) v. Watkin, (2008) F.C.J. No. 710; Canada (Attorney General) v. Rosin, (1991) 1. F.C. 391.)\n[96] Services performed by the government are generally deemed to be necessary for and of benefit to the public otherwise they would not need to be performed. Benefits and services are not necessarily synonymous. A service, such as the processing of an application for registration under the Indian Act to determine whether it complies with the legislative requirements for registration represents necessary work performed by government employees, on behalf of and for the benefit of the public (i.e. an applicant). Ultimately, if the work results in the application being approved and registration takes place, certain benefits will be available to the applicant upon registration, such as non-insured health benefits, eligibility to seek funding for post-secondary education, and certain tax exemptions. For a complaint to be substantiated under the CHRA, the failure to provide the service in a non-discriminatory manner, either through denial thereof or through adverse differentiation, on the basis of a prohibited ground, must be found to have an adverse or negative impact on a person.\n[97] The Complainant was already registered under s. 6(1)(f) of the Indian Act when she made her request for a change in registration to s. 6(1)(c) and a change in band membership, after advising the Respondent of her custom adoption for the first time in June of 2010. GEIRA had already been introduced and given first reading by the time she made the request, with provisions referred to previously herein, that would allow for her grandchildren to be registered for the first time under s. 6(2) provided that the Respondent recognized her custom adoption for the purposes of her registration under s. 6(1)(c). As such, although she was already receiving benefits available from registration under s. 6(1)(f), by initially denying her requests for the changes in registration and to her band membership, the Respondent, as a result of its incorrect interpretations in processing her request, caused her and her descendants to suffer the following negative or adverse impacts:\ni) She did not receive the benefit of being properly recognized as a custom adoptee of the parents who actually reared her from the time she was four days old. While the Registrar was prepared to note the custom adoption in the Complainant's records in December 2010, what the Registrar refused to do at that time was give any legal effect to the custom adoption as part of the Respondent's record keeping regime under s. 6. Failing to give legal effect to her life-long connection to her custom adoptive parents had a negative impact on her as an adoptee by deprecating her dignity. The significance of giving proper recognition to the parent-child connection of adoption has been held to be a service reviewable under human rights law as it marks a \"life-affirming process.\" (A.A. v. New Brunswick (Department of Family and Community Services), (2004) N.B.H.R.B.I.D. No. 4.)\nii) She did not receive the benefit of being able to have her name removed from a Band List that she was no longer interested in being on by simply requesting the removal of her name, thereby also deprecating her dignity. Neither s. 9 or s. 12 of the Indian Act uses the word \"transfer\" such that someone who is on a Band List and wants to be placed on another Band List (or simply doesn't want to be on any Band List) cannot obtain the removal of her name from the Band List she no longer wants to be on by simply requesting removal of her name, thereby avoiding the unnecessary, demeaning and wasteful exercise of obtaining consents from bands, as initially required by the Respondent in this case.\niii) She did not receive the benefit of being able to transmit s. 6(1)(c.1) status to her children (as opposed to s. 6(2)) and thereby to transmit s. (6)(2) status to their children (who were otherwise not eligible to be registered) when GEIRA came into effect on January 31, 2011 thereby denying her children the opportunity to access tangible benefits available to a person registered as an Indian.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

Court of Appeal in McIvor holding s. 6 inoperative as a consequence of it being contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and recognizing that the ability to transmit status to one's child was a benefit provided by the Indian Act, and indicating that it would be inclined to make the same finding about the ability to transmit status to one's grandchildren as well. GEIRA had already been introduced in Parliament by the time the requests were made in June 2010 and no doubt the new provisions were known to all of the parties at that time. In my opinion, it is perfectly understandable that the Complainant did not make the requests for changes to her status until June of 2010 since without GEIRA there would have been no tangible benefits available through registration to her grandchildren. As such, her delay in making the requests until June of 2010 and the period between the requests and the effective date of GEIRA is of no relevance or significance to this case. (McIvor v. Canada (Registrar, Indian and Northern Affairs), 2009 BCCA 153.)\n[99] The Murphy, Matson and Andrews cases are fundamentally distinguishable from this case on the basis that those cases did not involve complaints about anyone's conduct in exercising discretion in applying the relevant legislation. Instead, the Complaints in those cases all were directed at legislation and nothing else. In all of those cases changes by Parliament to the relevant legislation itself was what was really being sought through CHRA complaints rather than changes in the way that employees of the government were exercising any discretion in applying the legislation. The Respondent's excellent witness Ms. Linda McLenachan in fact testified that when the Respondent's employees eventually changed their positions on the registration request, they did so by viewing the wording of the same legislation with a \"different lens\" in their interpretation rather than by changing the wording of the legislation through an act of Parliament. The Respondent has admitted its earlier interpretation was incorrect not that any new legislation was required.\n[100] As such, in this case there was clearly a discretion to either interpret the legislation one way or the other with respect to both the change of registration request and the removal of the name from band membership request. Initially, the Respondent refused the requests based on its incorrect legal interpretations but ultimately the Respondent changed its positions without Parliament changing the legislation. In doing so the Respondent obviously knew it had the discretion to change its positions rather than having the legislation amended or it wouldn't have done so. Presumably these changes were based on what may be described as more \"flexible, liberal and purposeful\" interpretations. The fact that legal interpretations were obtained in this case from the Respondent's legal staff does not change the nature of the work performed by employees of the Respondent, as part of processing an application or request, to anything other than a service to the public, notwithstanding that the initial legal opinions were later found by the Respondent to be incorrect and changed.\n[101] In both initially choosing a narrower interpretation of the term \"child\" in the 1927 Indian Act that excluded custom adopted children, and in initially choosing a narrower interpretation of s. 12 of the Indian Act that precluded the removal on request of a person's name from a s. 11 Band List, the Respondent was exercising its discretion in the course of providing the service of processing an application or request.\n[102] Section 5 of the CHRA requires that services customarily available to the general public must be provided in a non-discriminatory manner. Where a statute has ambiguous language that can be interpreted in more than one way, the CHRA requires that the administering department choose the interpretation that is most consistent with human rights law principles.

In so doing, the Respondent used a restrictive legalistic approach that: (i) did not recognize custom adopted children as falling within the meaning of the word \"child\" in the 1927 Indian Act, (ii) limited persons who were custom adopted before April 17, 1985, but who applied for first-time registration after that date, to registration under ss. 6(1)(f) or 6(2) of the Indian Act, and, (iii) did not permit a request for removal of a name from a Band List without obtaining third party consent.\n[104] In making these incorrect initial interpretations the Respondent failed to choose the broad, liberal and purposive interpretations referred to in paragraph 94 herein and failed to choose interpretations that were most consistent with human rights principles referred to in paragraph 102 herein. Rather than using a \"different lens\" in later changing its interpretations, the Respondent instead should have opened its eyes to the correct interpretations in the first place. It would have saved us all considerable time and effort.\n[105] The Respondent's initial refusal for two and a half years to amend the Complainant's registration category and allow her to remove her name from the Fort Good Hope Band List, based upon its incorrect legal interpretations, constituted a denial of a service within the meaning of s. 5(a) of the CHRA as the Respondent's actions involved an improper discriminatory assessment of her entitlement to registration under s. 6(1)(c) and to her right on request to have her name removed from a Band List she did not want to be on any longer. As well, the Respondent's actions also constituted adverse differentiation in the provision of a service within the meaning of s. 5(b) as it involved drawing an adverse distinction in its legal interpretations for custom adopted children compared to biological children.\n[106] The denial or adverse differentiation in this case was based upon the Complainant's status as a custom adoptee and, as such, falls within the prohibited ground of \"family status\" under s. 3 of the CHRA. The Tribunal and the Courts have held that family status includes the relationship between adoptive parents and children and that adverse distinctions drawn between adopted and biological children are discriminatory on the basis of family status under the CHRA. I believe an aboriginal certified custom adoptee is entitled to the same treatment under the law as a legal adoptee. (Seeley v. Canadian National Railway, 2010 CHRT 23; Canada (Attorney General) v. McKenna, (1998) 1 F.C.J. No. 1501; Grismer v. Squamish Indian Band, 2006 FC 1088; Worthington v. Canada, 2008 FC 409.)\nC. Does the defence of bona fide justification apply in this case? [107] Where a Complainant proves a prima facie case of discrimination under s. 5 of the CHRA, the burden shifts to the respondent to rebut the prima facie case, either by showing that events did not occur as alleged, or that it had a bona fide justification for its conduct, under s. 15(1)(g) of 15(2) of the CHRA.\n[108] The defence of bona fide justification under the CHRA is to be interpreted and applied in light of Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence, which establishes that it will only be made out where, among other things, the approach taken by the respondent was \"reasonably necessary\", in the sense that departing from the approach would have caused undue hardship. (British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), (1999) 3 S.C.R. 868.)\n[109] In this case, the Respondent has already changed its approach, at least insofar as the Complainant is concerned, by (i) amending her category of registration to s. 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act, (ii) recognizing her entitlement to be added to the Band List for the band of her custom adoptive parents and, (iii) removing her name from the Band List of the Fort Good Hope band. This is effectively an admission that the previous exclusionary approach was not \"reasonably necessary\" within the meaning of the applicable jurisprudence, and that the previous approach therefore did not have a bona fide justification within the meaning of the CHRA and applicable case law.\nVIII. Decision [110] On the basis of the foregoing reasons, I find that the Complaint in this matter has been substantiated.\nIX.

(2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate:\n(a) that the person cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in future, including\n(i) the adoption of a special program, plan or arrangement referred to in subsection 16(1), or\n(ii) making an application for approval and implementing a plan under section 17;\n(b) that the person make available to the victim of discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being or were denied the victim as a result of the practice;\n(c) that the person compensate the victim for any and all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice;\n(d) that the person compensate the victim for any or all additional costs of obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities or accommodation and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice; and\n(e) that the person compensate the victim, by an amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n(3) In addition to any order under subsection (2), the member or panel may order the person to pay such compensations not exceeding twenty thousand dollars to the victim as the member of the panel may determine if the member or panel finds that the person is engaging or has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\n[112] As noted in paragraphs 67 and 68 herein, the Complainant seeks remedies of a declaration and an order for payment for breach of individual treaty rights that she alleges arise out of the breach by the Respondent of Treaty 11 rights on behalf of herself and her descendants. In this respect, the Complainant has tried to expand the Complaint beyond what it really was as referred to in paragraph 2 herein, arising out of the refusal of the Respondent of her requests of June of 2010 to change her registration status and to remove her name from her former Band List. I have no jurisdiction to make such a declaration or award such payments both because there was no evidentiary basis presented in support of this position at the hearing and because these allegations and remedies are beyond the scope of the matters at issue at the hearing and the above legislation governing remedies.\n[113] The Complainant did not claim compensation under s. 53 (2) (e) under the Act for pain and suffering in spite of my specifically asking her representative about this at the hearing. As such, it would be unfair to the Respondent for me to now make an order under that provision despite my findings of the impacts of its discriminatory conduct. I do feel, however, on the evidence before me, that the conduct of the Respondent in refusing the Complainant's requests was done with full knowledge of the consequences to the Complainant and her descendants of its actions over the two and a half years before it changed its positions. In my opinion, the later interpretations that it chose to make with respect to these requests should have been clear to the Respondent from the outset in keeping with the purposeful and liberal attitude that should be adopted in making interpretations of this nature in these circumstances. As such, I find that its conduct in this respect was intentional and willful and falls within s. 53 (3) above.\n[114] As well, I believe that the public interest remedies requested by the Commission are in order, subject to a six months period to create and implement the directives as requested by the Respondent. In this regard I am pleased to know that the Respondent had, at the time of the hearing, already begun the drafting of the necessary directives.\nX. Order [115] Therefore, the Tribunal orders and directs as follows:\nA. That the Respondent cease the discriminatory practices of:\ni) refusing to recognize the adopted child of a male Indian as a \"child\" of the male Indian, as that term was used in the 1927 Indian Act; and\nii) refusing to consider first-time registrations for adoptees who were adopted before April 17, 1985, under any provisions other than ss. 6(1)(f) or 6(2) of the Indian Act;\nB. The Respondent, within six months of the date of the Tribunal's decision,\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

L'intime reconnait que Gwichya Gwich'in est le nom contemporain de la bande des Loucheaux no 6.\n[11] Le nom de la plaignante n'a pas ete ajoute a la liste de paiement des annuites prevues dans le Traite no 11 pour la bande connue a l'epoque sous le nom de Loucheaux no 6 au moment de son adoption selon la coutume autochtone.\n[12] Le 4 septembre 1951, d'importantes modifications a la Loi sur les Indiens sont entrees en vigueur. La loi modificative, Loi sur les Indiens, L.C. 1951, ch. 29, prevoyait notamment ce qui suit :\n2. (1) Dans la presente loi, l'expression\n[...]\nb) << enfant >> comprend un enfant indien legalement adopte ;\n[...]\ng) << Indien >> signifie une personne qui, conformement a la presente loi, est inscrite a titre d'Indien ou a droit de l'etre ;\n[...]\nj) << membre d'une bande >> signifie une personne dont le nom apparait sur une liste de bande ou qui a droit a ce que son nom y figure ;\n[...]\n11.

Une femme qui est membre d'une bande cesse d'en faire partie si elle epouse une personne qui n'en est pas membre, mais si elle epouse un membre d'une autre bande, elle entre des lors dans la bande a laquelle appartient son mari.\n[13] L'article 5 de la Loi sur les Indiens de 1951 creait un registre des Indiens << ou doit etre consigne le nom de chaque personne ayant droit d'etre inscrite comme Indien >>. Jusque-la, il n'y avait jamais eu de registre centralise pour l'inscription des Indiens ; au lieu de cela, l'intime tenait, pour chaque bande, une liste de paiement des annuites prevues par le traite ou une liste des membres de la bande. A l'entree en vigueur des modifications de 1951, les listes deja etablies pour les bandes ont ete colligees pour former le registre des Indiens ; parallelement, une liste generale a ete creee afin de recevoir le nom des personnes qui avaient le droit d'etre inscrites au registre, mais qui n'appartenaient pas a une bande\n[14] Le 6 avril 1974, la plaignante a epouse Bruce Beattie, qui n'etait pas inscrit au registre prevu par la Loi sur les Indiens et qui n'avait pas le droit d'y etre inscrit. En raison de ce mariage, Mme Beattie a perdu tout droit eventuel d'inscription et d'appartenance a une bande conformement aux dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens en vigueur a l'epoque en matiere de mariage avec un non-Indien. Ces dispositions s'appliquaient uniquement aux femmes.\n[15] Le 17 mars 1975, la plaignante et Bruce Beattie ont eu un fils, T'Seluq Beattie.\n[16] Le 1er juin 1976, la plaignante et Bruce Beattie ont eu une fille, Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie).\n[17] Le 17 avril 1985, le Projet de loi C-31 : Loi modifiant la Loi sur les Indiens, est entre en vigueur. En consequence, la Loi sur les Indiens a ete substantiellement modifiee. Les nouvelles dispositions prevoyaient notamment ce qui suit :\n2. (1) Les dispositions qui suivent s'appliquent a la presente loi.\n[...]\n<< enfant >> S'entend notamment d'un enfant indien legalement adopte.\n<< Indien >> Personne qui, conformement a la presente loi, est inscrite a titre d'Indien ou a droit de l'etre.\n[...]\n<< membre d'une bande >> Personne dont le nom apparait sur une liste de bande ou qui a droit a ce que son nom y figure.\n[...]\n5.

Au lendemain de l'entree en vigueur des modifications du projet de loi C-31, ces paragraphes avaient respectivement les roles suivants :\nle paragraphe 6(1) etablissait les categories de personnes ayant droit a l'inscription, dont les suivantes :\ntoute personne qui etait inscrite ou avait le droit de l'etre le jour precedant l'entree en vigueur des modifications de 1985 (al. 6(1)c)) ;\nles femmes dont le nom avait ete omis ou retranche d'une liste de bande (avant le 4 septembre 1951) ou du registre des Indiens (a compter du 4 septembre 1951) en raison de leur mariage avec un non-Indien (al. 6(1)c)) ;\nles personnes dont les deux parents sont Indiens (al. 6(1)f) ;\nle paragraphe 6(2) rendait admissibles a l'inscription les personnes dont l'un des parents est Indien.\n[19] Les personnes inscrites ou ayant le droit de l'etre en vertu du paragraphe 6(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens peuvent transmettre ce droit a l'inscription aux enfants qu'ils ont avec des personnes non inscrites ou n'ayant pas le droit a l'inscription sous le regime de la Loi sur les Indiens. En revanche, les personnes inscrites ou ayant le droit de l'etre en vertu du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens ne peuvent transmettre ce meme droit aux enfants qu'ils ont avec des personnes non inscrites ou n'ayant pas le droit a l'inscription sous le regime de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[20] Les modifications prevues au projet de loi C-31 permettaient a la bande d'assumer le controle sur ses membres et de maintenir sa propre liste, moyennant certaines conditions (Loi sur les Indiens, article 10). Toutefois, jusqu'a ce qu'elle en assume la responsabilite, la liste de la bande est tenue au ministere par le registraire des Indiens, qui peut y ajouter ou en retrancher le nom des personnes ayant ou n'ayant pas le droit d'y figurer aux termes de la Loi (Loi sur les Indiens, article 9). Le registraire des Indiens n'est pas tenu d'ajouter un nom a la liste d'une bande a moins qu'une demande d'inscription a cet effet ne lui soit presentee (Loi sur les Indiens, paragraphe 9(5)).\n[21] Les modifications apportees a la Loi sur les Indiens dans le cadre du projet de loi C-31 ont modifie les droits a l'inscription au registre des parents biologiques de la plaignante. En effet, par suite de ces modifications : (i) James Delap Harris a obtenu le droit a l'inscription en vertu du paragraphe 6(2) et (ii) Roselia (ou Rosalie) Harris (nee Arruka ou Aruke) a obtenu ce droit en vertu de l'alinea 6(1)c).\n[22] Vers le 1er septembre 1985, la plaignante a fait parvenir au registraire des Indiens une demande d'inscription pour elle-meme et ses enfants sous le regime de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[23] En 1986, l'intime a inscrit la plaignante au registre, suivant l'al. 6(1)f), du fait de sa filiation biologique. Il a egalement inscrit ses enfants suivant le paragraphe 6(2), etant donne que ceux-ci avaient un parent qui etait inscrit (la plaignante) et un parent qui ne l'etait pas et n'avait pas droit de l'etre (M. Beattie). Quelque temps apres, l'intime a ajoute les noms de la plaignante et de ses enfants a la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope (la bande de la mere biologique de la plaignante), cette bande ayant decide de ne pas adopter de regles propres en matiere d'appartenance a ses membres.\n[24] Dans une lettre datee du 10 mars 1986, le registraire des Indiens a informe la plaignante qu'elle et ses enfants avaient ete inscrits sous le regime de la Loi sur les Indiens. Il y expliquait egalement (i) que si la bande de Fort Good Hope decidait, avant le 28 juin 1987, d'assumer la responsabilite de sa propre liste de bande, la plaignante devrait presenter une demande a la bande afin d'etre inscrite avec ses enfants sur la liste de cette bande et (ii) que si la bande de Fort Good Hope n'assumait pas la responsabilite de sa liste avant le 28 juin 1987, la plaignante et ses enfants auraient le droit d'etre inscrits comme membres de cette bande suivant l'al. 11(2)b) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

Par consequent, le registraire des Indiens a ajoute le nom de la plaignante et de ses enfants, T'Seluq Beattie et Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie) a la liste de bande de Fort Good Hope en date du 28 juin 1987.\n[26] Le 3 mars 2010, la Loi sur l'equite entre les sexes relativement a l'inscription au registre des Indiens (la LESIRI) a ete deposee au Parlement et adoptee en premiere lecture. En autres choses, la LESIRI ajoutait une nouvelle disposition a la Loi sur les Indiens, l'al. 6(1)c.1), qui conferait le droit a l'inscription a l'enfant issu d'un mariage entre un homme non inscrit et n'ayant pas droit a l'inscription et une femme visee a l'alinea 6(1)c) dont le nom a ete, en raison du mariage, retranche d'une liste de bande (avant le 4 septembre 1951) ou du registre des Indiens (a partir du 4 septembre 1951), si les conditions suivantes etaient reunies : (i) l'enfant est ne apres la date du mariage; (ii) l'enfant a lui-meme eu ou adopte un enfant avec une personne non inscrite et n'ayant pas droit a l'inscription le 4 septembre 1951 ou apres cette date. La LESIRI a ete adoptee en troisieme lecture a la Chambre des communes le 22 novembre 2010, et au Senat le 9 decembre 2010. Le projet de loi a recu la sanction royale le 15 decembre 2010 et la LESIRI est entree en vigueur le 31 janvier 2011.\n[27] Dans une lettre datee du 22 avril 1993, le sous-ministre de l'intime a officiellement reconnu ce qui suit, conformement a un reglement intervenu avec la Couronne au sujet des annuites :\n[Traduction] Les droits conferes par le Traite no 11 a Joyce Wilma Beattie, Nikota Beattie et T'Seluq Beattie ne sont pas lies au statut, mais ils pourraient etre rattaches a d'autres facteurs, dont l'ascendance. En ce qui concerne Joyce Wilma Beattie, Nikota Beattie et T'Seluq Beattie, les droits a l'annuite prevue par le Traite no 11 ont ete acquis a la naissance et ont continue d'exister par la suite, et il s'agit de droits issus de traites reconnus et confirmes par le paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982.\n[28] Dans une lettre adressee au registraire des Indiens en date du 2 juin 2010, la plaignante a, pour la premiere fois, informe l'intime du fait qu'elle avait ete adoptee selon la coutume autochtone et qu'elle avait obtenu de la Cour supreme des Territoires du Nord-Ouest un certificat attestant la legalite de cette adoption survenue en date du 8 decembre 1949. Elle demandait des lors ce qui suit : (i) le remplacement de sa categorie d'inscription, soit celle prevue a l'alinea 6(1)f) de la Loi sur les Indiens, par celle de l'alinea 6(1)c), du fait de son adoption selon la coutume autochtone, et (ii) le remplacement de la bande a laquelle elle etait affiliee, soit la bande a laquelle appartenait sa mere biologique (752, Good Hope), par celle a laquelle appartenaient ses parents adoptifs (753, Gwichya Gwich'in).\n[29] Dans une lettre adressee a la plaignante en date du 7 decembre 2010, le registraire des Indiens a notamment declare ce qui suit : (i) l'adoption de la plaignante selon la coutume autochtone ne lui conferait pas le droit a l'inscription sous le regime de l'alinea 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens; (ii) [Traduction] << [a] titre indicatif, les categories d'inscription de la personne adoptee par deux parents indiens sont prevues a l'alinea 6(1)f) de la Loi sur les Indiens et celle de la personne adoptee par des parents dont l'un est Indien est prevue au paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens >>; (iii) si la plaignante souhaitait modifier son affiliation afin de devenir membre de la bande de ses parents adoptifs, elle devait communiquer avec le bureau regional du MAINC situe aux Territoires du Nord-Ouest afin de demander un transfert officiel.\n[30] Dans une lettre adressee a la plaignante en date du 16 decembre 2010, le registraire des Indiens a informe cette derniere de ce qui suit : (i) il etait convaincu que la plaignante avait ete adoptee selon la coutume autochtone aux Territoires du Nord-Ouest; (ii) les noms de ses parents adoptifs avaient ete consignes au registre des Indiens; (iii) son inscription continuait de relever de la categorie prevue a l'alinea 6(1)f) de la Loi sur les Indiens;(iv) elle demeurait membre de la bande de Fort Good Hope suivant l'al. 11(2)b) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[31] T'Seluq Beattie a eu un enfant avec Stephanie Beattie (qui n'est pas inscrite et n'a pas droit de l'etre sous le regime de la Loi sur les Indiens) : Theron Beattie, ne le 16 octobre 2003.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

Dans une lettre datee du 7 fevrier 2012, le registraire des Indiens l'a informee que parce qu'elle etait inscrite sous le regime du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens et que Reynold Bangloy n'etait pas considere comme une personne inscrite ou ayant le droit de l'etre, il n'avait pas pu conclure que Brodin Bangloy avait le droit d'etre inscrit. Le 23 fevrier 2012, le registraire a envoye une lettre au meme effet concernant Jreyden Bangloy.\n[35] Dans une lettre datee du 9 decembre 2012, l'avocat de l'intime a fait savoir que l'intime avait modifie son point de vue et qu'il etait desormais dispose a reconnaitre que la plaignante avait le droit d'etre inscrite sous le regime de l'alinea 6(1)c). Ce retournement s'expliquait par le fait que l'intime avait modifie l'interpretation qu'elle donnait au mot << enfant >> dans la Loi des Indiens de 1927. Jusque-la, selon l'interpretation qu'il en avait faite, ce terme ne visait que les enfants biologiques d'un Indien du sexe masculin. Or, comme l'a indique Mme McLeynachan lorsqu'elle a temoigne pour le compte de l'intime, celui-ci avait decide de considerer le terme [Traduction] << sous un autre angle >> desormais, en elargissant la portee de sa definition aux enfants adoptes selon la coutume autochtone. Cette nouvelle interpretation a eu les consequences suivantes :\nla plaignante est devenue une << Indienne >> le 8 decembre 1949, etant l'enfant d'un Indien du sexe masculin (son pere adoptif selon la coutume autochtone) ;\nla plaignante avait le droit d'etre inscrite a titre d'Indienne en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens de 1951 ;\nla plaignante a perdu ce droit a l'inscription lors de son mariage avec Bruce Beattie en 1974 ;\nil s'ensuit que la plaignante etait une femme ayant perdu un droit avant le 17 avril 1985 en raison de son mariage et qu'a cette date, elle remplissait les conditions de l'alinea 6(1)c) ;\nses enfants, T'Seluq Beattie et Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie), avaient le droit d'etre inscrits sous le regime de l'alinea 6(1)c.1), au lieu du paragraphe 6(2) ;\nses petits-enfants, Jreyden et Brodin Bangloy, et Theron Beattie, avaient desormais le droit d'etre inscrits, et ce, sous le regime du paragraphe 6(2), parce que leurs parents avaient acquis le droit a l'inscription sous le regime de l'alinea 6(1)c.1) ;\nla plaignante et ses enfants continuaient d'appartenir a la bande de Fort Good Hope ;\nla plaignante et ses enfants pouvaient demander le transfert de leur appartenance a une autre bande de leur choix, conformement a l'article 12 de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[36] Le 3 janvier 2013, la plaignante a recu une lettre du registraire l'informant, entre autres, de deux choses : (i) par suite d'un examen plus pousse, le droit a l'enregistrement de la plaignante etait passe de la categorie prevue a l'alinea 6(1)f) de la Loi sur les Indiens a celle de l'alinea 6(1)c); (ii) elle maintenait desormais son appartenance a la bande de Fort Good Hope en vertu de l'alinea 11(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[37] Vers le 3 ou le 4 janvier 2013, le registraire des Indiens a modifie les categories d'inscription de T'Seluq Beattie et Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie) de facon a ce qu'ils soient desormais inscrits sous le regime de l'alinea 6(1)c.1) de la Loi sur les Indiens, au lieu du paragraphe 6(2).\n[38] Le 4 janvier 2013, le registraire des Indiens (i) a inscrit Theron Beattie et Brodin et Jreyden Bangloy sous le regime du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens ; (ii) a ajoute les noms de Theron Beattie et de Brodin et Jreyden Bangloy a la liste des membres de la bande de Fort Good Hope conformement a l'alinea 11(2)b) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[39] Dans une lettre adressee a l'administrateur de l'inscription des Indiens de la bande de Fort Good Hope en date du 4 janvier 2013, le registraire des Indiens a justifie comme suit l'inscription de Theron Beattie sous le regime du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens :\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

Sa mere, JOYCE WILMA BEATTIE, nee HARRIS le 4 decembre 1949, s'est inscrite sous le regime de l'alinea 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens sous le no 7520073601. Modification de l'alinea 6(1)f) a l'alinea 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens le 3 janvier 2013. Le droit initial etait fonde sur le sous-alinea 2d)(ii) de la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C. 1927, ch. 98, qui prevoit que << tout enfant >> d'un individu du sexe masculin a droit d'etre inscrit comme Indien. Ainsi, en tant qu'enfant adoptee par un Indien inscrit selon la coutume autochtone le 8 decembre 1949, elle aurait eu le droit d'etre inscrite comme Indienne au moment de l'adoption. Elle a epouse BRUCE ALLAN BEATTIE, un non-Indien, le 6 avril 1974.\n[40] Meme si la question de l'inscription de la plaignante est desormais reglee, l'intime continue de refuser de modifier la bande a laquelle elle appartenait selon la loi. Les parties ont echange d'autres precisions sur cet aspect. Dans son expose des precisions modifie, l'intime a reconnu que la plaignante avait droit a ce que son nom soit ajoute a la liste de la bande Gwichya Gwich'in, mais elle a precise qu'elle ne pouvait proceder au changement puisque son nom figurait deja dans la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope et que le seul moyen d'obtenir qu'il soit consigne dans la liste des Gwichya Gwich'in consistait a [Traduction] << transferer son appartenance conformement a l'alinea 12b) de la Loi sur les Indiens >>.\n[41] Dans des lettres adressees a l'avocat de l'intime et portant les dates du 27 mars et du 18 avril 2013, le representant de la plaignante a demande a l'intime de retrancher les noms de la plaignante, de Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie), de T'Seluq Beattie, de Jreyden Bangloy, de Brodin Bangloy et de Theron Beattie de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope.\n[42] Dans une lettre adressee au representant de la plaignante et datee du 29 avril 2013, le registraire des Indiens par interim a informe ce dernier, entre autres choses, de ce qui suit : (i) les noms de la plaignante, de Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie), de T'Seluq Beattie, de Jreyden Bangloy et de Brodin Bangloy avaient ete retranches de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope le 29 avril 2013; (ii) le nom de Theron Beattie serait retranche de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope le 30 avril 2013. L'intime avait ainsi modifie sa position precedente, selon laquelle les noms de la plaignante et de ses descendants ne pouvaient etre retranches de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope sans qu'il y ait << transfert >> suivant l'alinea 12d) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[43] S'ils le souhaitent, la plaignante et ses descendants peuvent demander a ce que leurs noms soient ajoutes a la liste de la bande Gwichya Gwich'in. La plaignante a confirme qu'elle ne le souhaite plus.\n[44] La plainte souleve les questions suivantes :\nIII. Les questions en litige\n(a) L'affaire est-elle devenue theorique du fait de la modification de la categorie d'inscription dont releve la plaignante en janvier 2013 et du retrait de son nom de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope en avril 2013 ?\n(b) La plaignante et la Commission se sont-elles correctement acquittees du fardeau d'etablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fondee sur la situation de famille ou le sexe, en contravention de l'article 5 de la LCDP ?\n(c) S'il y a eu discrimination a premiere vue, l'intime s'est-il acquitte du fardeau de prouver que son refus de proceder aux modifications demandees concernant la categorie d'inscription applicable a la plaignante et sa bande d'appartenance, en juin 2010, reposait sur un motif justifiable ?\n(d) S'il y a eu discrimination a premiere vue sans motif justifiable, quelles seraient les mesures de reparation appropriees ?\nIV. Resume des observations de la Commission\n[45] Dans une lettre datee du 2 juin 2010, la plaignante a demande a l'intime de faire passer la categorie d'inscription qui lui etait applicable de celle prevue a l'alinea 6(1)f) a celle de l'alinea 6(1)c), du fait qu'elle avait ete adoptee selon la coutume autochtone, et de retrancher son nom de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope afin de l'ajouter a celui de la bande de ses parents adoptifs, la bande d'Arctic Red River (753 Gwichya Gwich'in, T.N.-O.). La question qui se pose est de savoir si, en repondant a ces demandes, l'intime etait engage dans la prestation de << services [...] destines au public >> au sens de l'article 5 de la LCDP.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

Comme les mesures du gouvernement sont generalement prises au profit du public, l'exigence prevue a l'article 5, suivant laquelle elles doivent etre << destinees au public >>, est habituellement satisfaite dans les affaires se rapportant a des mesures prises par le gouvernement.\n[47] Faire droit aux demandes de la plaignante revenait a conferer des avantages qui n'etaient pas offerts autrement.\n[48] Lorsqu'il a traite la demande de la plaignante et a rendu sa decision concernant son droit a l'inscription et a l'ajout de son nom consigne a la liste d'une certaine bande, l'intime fournissait des services au sens de l'article 5 de la LCDP car il a du, dans le cadre du traitement de la demande, exercer son pouvoir discretionnaire afin de determiner si les criteres d'inscription prevus dans la Loi sur les Indiens etaient remplis.\n[49] Contrairement aux situations qui prevalaient dans Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2012 CAF 7 (<< Murphy >>), Matson et al. c. Indian & Northern Affairs Canada (aujourd'hui appele Affaires autochtones et Developpement du Nord Canada), 2013 CHRT 13 (<< Matson >>) et Andrews et al. c. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2013 CHRT 21 (<< Andrews >>), nous avons affaire ici a un cas ou l'intime disposait, dans le cadre du traitement de la demande de la plaignante, du pouvoir discretionnaire de decider de l'interpretation a donner au terme << enfant >> dans la Loi des Indiens de 1927. En decidant dans un premier temps de donner a ce terme, dans le cadre du traitement de la demande, une definition restrictive excluant les enfants adoptes, l'intime a exerce son pouvoir discretionnaire au lieu d'appliquer une disposition legale a caractere imperatif. Les choix qu'il a faits a cet egard sont parfaitement susceptibles d'un controle en vertu de l'article 5 de la LCDP, puisqu'ils concernent la prestation de services destines au public.\n[50] Durant la periode comprise entre la demande initiale (2 juin 2010) et le changement de la categorie d'inscription applicable (confirme le 3 janvier 2013), l'intime a refuse a la plaignante le service qu'elle demandait, a savoir, l'evaluation juste et non discriminatoire de son droit a l'inscription sous le regime de l'alinea 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens. Il l'a ainsi privee d'un service au sens de l'alinea 5a) de la LCDP. A titre subsidiaire, durant cette meme periode, l'intime a defavorise la plaignante a l'occasion de la fourniture de ce service. Plus precisement, en procedant a l'evaluation du droit de cette derniere d'etre inscrite sous le regime de l'alinea 6(1)c), l'intime a choisi d'etablir des distinctions entre enfants biologiques et enfants adoptes selon la coutume autochtone. Il s'agit d'une difference de traitement defavorable au sens de l'alinea 5b) de la LCDP.\n[51] L'intime a maintenu sa decision de refuser la demande de la plaignante en matiere d'inscription pendant au moins deux ans apres l'entree en vigueur de la LESIRI, le 31 janvier 2011. Le refus de modifier la categorie d'inscription applicable a compromis la possibilite pour la plaignante de transmettre son droit a l'inscription a ses descendants pendant cette periode, ainsi qu'a sa capacite de veiller a ce que les registres gouvernementaux tiennent dument compte de son adoption selon la coutume autochtone en reconnaissant la bonne filiation.\n[52] En l'espece, l'intime a admis que l'obstacle ayant initialement empeche de faire droit a la demande de modification de la categorie d'inscription applicable a la plaignante etait lie a sa situation d'enfant adoptee, de sorte qu'elle etait consideree comme l'<< enfant >> de son pere adoptif selon la Loi des Indiens de 1927 et qu'elle ne pouvait des lors etre inscrite que sous le regime de l'alinea 6(1)f) ou du paragraphe 6(2). En ce sens, le refus de l'intime ou la difference de traitement defavorable qu'il a etablie etait fonde sur la situation de la plaignante en tant qu'enfant adoptee selon la coutume autochtone, un aspect vise par le motif de distinction illicite de la << situation de famille >> selon la LCDP.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

En ce sens, bien qu'il tire son origine de questions liees a la situation de famille, l'acte discriminatoire releve par la Commission a egalement eu des repercussions prejudiciables croisees liees a l'identite de la plaignante en tant que femme autochtone.\n[54] En modifiant sa position concernant l'inscription de la plaignante et son appartenance a une bande, l'intime a effectivement reconnu que l'interpretation restrictive qu'il avait anterieurement adoptee n'etait pas [Traduction] << raisonnablement necessaire >> au sens de la jurisprudence applicable et que, partant, son point de vue anterieur ne reposait pas sur un motif justifiable selon la LCDP et la jurisprudence applicable.\n[55] La plainte ne devrait pas etre rejetee au motif qu'elle est devenue theorique, car certaines questions demeurent non reglees en matiere de reparation depuis que l'intime a modifie sa position vis-a-vis de l'inscription et de l'appartenance a une bande. Pour pouvoir juger du bien-fonde de la plainte, le Tribunal doit, entre autres choses, determiner si l'intime a commis un acte discriminatoire ou non.\n[56] Le Tribunal devrait ordonner a l'intime, en vertu de l'alinea 53(2)a), de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement a leurs objectifs generaux, des mesures destinees a prevenir des actes semblables.\n[57] La plaignante souscrit aux observations de la Commission et les fait siennes.\n[58] La plaignante soutient qu'elle-meme et ses descendants ont ete prives des services administratifs auxquels ils ont droit suivant le Traite no 11, particulierement en ce qui concerne l'appartenance a une bande visee par un traite, le versement des annuites, l'aide financiere aux etudes et la tenue de registres.\n[59] Par suite de la modification, en 1985, des regles de la Loi sur les Indiens regissant le droit a l'inscription (projet de loi C-31), ce droit n'est plus lie a l'appartenance a une bande etablie en vertu de la loi et ne peut avoir d'incidence sur l'effectif d'une bande visee par un traite. Il s'ensuit que l'inscription sous le regime de la Loi sur les Indiens n'a eu aucun effet sur les droits issus de traites depuis 1982 en raison de l'ediction de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, de sorte que depuis 1985 au moins, les listes de paiement des annuites prevues par traite ne sont pas les memes que les listes des bandes etablies en vertu de la loi et qu'elles ne determinent pas l'appartenance a une bande selon la loi. Le droit d'appartenir a une bande repose sur des qualites personnelles differentes. L'appartenance a une bande visee par un traite est d'ordre constitutionnel et repose exclusivement sur la filiation biologique par rapport a un Indien qui a adhere au traite d'origine et sur la situation de famille actuelle. L'appartenance a une bande selon la loi, quant a elle, n'a pas de caractere constitutionnel et elle depend exclusivement, soit des regles de l'article 11, soit des regles etablies par la bande en vertu du pouvoir delegue prevu a l'article 10 de la Loi sur les Indiens, et les unes comme les autres n'exigent pas forcement comme condition une preuve de filiation naturelle ou une situation de famille particuliere.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

Tous sont egalement membres de la bande des Loucheaux no 6 d'Arctic Red River visee par le Traite no 11, car c'est a cette bande que le Canada a officiellement reconnu que la plaignante appartenait du fait de son adoption selon la coutume autochtone, et ses descendants naturels ont le droit d'appartenir a cette meme bande qui figure toujours dans les listes de paiement des annuites prevues par traite. Tout ce qui precede a ete garanti a chacun d'eux par l'article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 depuis le 17 avril 1982.\n[62] Les Indiens signataires du Traite no 11 ont egalement le droit constitutionnel d'etre correctement designes dans tous les documents administratifs du Canada, y compris dans les listes de paiement des annuites prevues par traite et dans le registre des Indiens.\n[63] Apres le premier versement de l'annuite a un adherent du Traite no 11, l'intime maintient, a titre de service permanent, des registres de tous les paiements annuels posterieurs sans qu'il ne soit jamais necessaire de renouveler l'adhesion et tous les changements survenus dans la situation de famille ou l'affiliation a une bande sont simplement consignes dans les listes de paiement au moment du versement annuel.\n[64] Jusqu'en 2011 inclusivement, l'intime a fourni les services administratifs requis par le Traite no 11 et a verse a la plaignante et a chacun de ses enfants l'annuite prevue au traite chaque annee de leur vie depuis leur naissance. La plaignante et ses enfants ont ainsi ete officiellement reconnus comme des adherents au Traite no 11 et ont touche les annuites y prevues sur le seul fondement de leurs actes de naissance, lesquels indiquent qu'ils sont des descendants naturels d'adherents au Traite no 11 de 1921. Depuis 1921, la seule chose que les descendants des adherents au Traite no 11 ont eu a produire pour prouver leurs droits au titre du traite et etre ajoutes a la liste de paiement des annuites relative a la bande a laquelle appartenaient leurs ancetres est leur acte de naissance officiel, si tant est qu'ils en possedaient un.\n[65] En 2011, les enfants de la plaignante ont fourni a l'intime des exemplaires des actes de naissance de leurs enfants naturels et, en qualite de chefs de famille, ont demande a ce que l'annuite prevue au Traite no 11 leur soit versee a eux-memes et a leurs enfants. L'intime a refuse de verser l'annuite aux petits-enfants de la plaignante au motif qu'ils n'etaient pas inscrits sous le regime de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

La plaignante soutient que ces decisions administratives sont injustifiees, que ce soit au vu des clauses du Traite no 11 ou des dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens, et qu'elles portent par consequent atteinte aux droits constitutionnellement garantis qui sont issus du Traite no 11.\n[67] En vertu de l'alinea 53(2)b) de la LCDP, la plaignante demande au Tribunal de declarer qu'elle-meme, ses deux enfants et ses trois petits-enfants sont tous des Indiens vises par le Traite no 11 depuis leur naissance respective et qu'ils jouissent par consequent, a titre personnel, des droits, benefices et privileges existants qui sont garantis par la constitution aux Indiens vises par le Traite no 11, y compris le droit d'appartenir a la bande indienne designee a l'origine sous le nom de Loucheaux no 6 d'Arctic Red River et visee par le Traite no 11 et d'etre officiellement inscrits a ce titre dans les listes de paiement des annuites etablies pour cette bande conformement au Traite no 11.\n[68] En vertu des alineas 53(2)c) et d) de la Loi sur les Indiens, la plaignante demande, au benefice de ses trois petits-enfants, que l'intime soit tenu de payer immediatement les arrieres des annuites qui leur sont dues en vertu du Traite no 11 pour chacune des annees de leur vie ainsi que le remboursement de tous les frais de scolarite engages jusqu'a present pour leur instruction, frais que l'intime s'est engage a payer en vertu des clauses du Traite no 11, mais dont il a retenu le versement jusqu'a ce qu'il soit statue sur la presente plainte .\n[69] La plaignante pretend egalement qu'en tant que victimes d'actes deliberes ou inconsideres, ses deux enfants, ses trois petits-enfants et elle-meme ont droit, chacun, au versement d'une indemnite speciale de la part de l'intime en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[70] Il ne subsiste plus de litige entre les parties en ce qui a trait au droit a l'inscription de la plaignante du fait que l'intime est revenu sur sa position le 9 decembre 2013 et que, pour cette raison, la question litigieuse est devenue theorique.\n[71] Il ne subsiste plus de litige entre les parties en ce qui a trait a l'appartenance a une bande selon la loi du fait que l'intime est revenu sur sa position concernant le retranchement des noms de la plaignante et de ses descendants de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope le 29 avril 2013 et que la plaignante a retire sa demande visant a faire ajouter son nom a la liste de la bande Gwichya Gwich'in. Pour ces raisons, cette question est elle aussi devenue theorique.\n[72] La plainte vise a contester la loi, et rien de plus, exactement comme dans l'affaire Matson. La plainte traite de l'interpretation de l'article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens et du terme << enfant >> dans la Loi des Indiens de 1927.\n[73] Le registraire a procede a l'interpretation du terme << enfant >> aux fins de l'application de l'article 6 afin de pouvoir determiner correctement quelle categorie s'appliquait a la plaignante en matiere d'inscription a titre d'Indien et, pour ce faire, il n'a exerce aucun pouvoir discretionnaire. Lorsqu'il a reexamine et modifie son interpretation, le registraire n'a pas non plus exerce de pouvoir discretionnaire (l'article 6 ne confere aucun pouvoir discretionnaire quant au traitement des enfants adoptes selon la coutume autochtone) : il a simplement rectifie l'interpretation erronee qu'il avait faite des dispositions legislatives.\n[74] La plaignante conteste non pas la maniere dont sa demande d'inscription a ete traitee, mais bien l'interpretation donnee par le registraire au mot << enfant >> et aux regles etablissant le droit a l'inscription qui sont enoncees a l'article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens. On ne peut raisonnablement parler de << service >> dans le cas de ces criteres qui ont ete prescrits par le Parlement en vertu de la competence que lui confere le paragraphe 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle.

La prise en compte de ces elements demontre qu'il est impossible d'evaluer une mesure de contestation d'une loi comme la presente plainte de maniere appropriee au moyen de ces mecanismes.\n[76] Si le Tribunal conclut que la plainte vise uniquement a contester la legislation, il s'ensuit qu'il n'a pas la competence voulue pour en etre saisi, conformement a ce qui a ete decide dans Murphy, Matson et Andrews, et que la plainte devrait par consequent etre rejetee. Dans l'eventualite ou le Tribunal estimerait que la plainte n'est pas theorique et qu'elle releve de sa competence, l'intime soutient que ses actes n'etaient pas discriminatoires.\n[77] L'intime reconnait que les criteres applicables en matiere de discrimination ne sont pas forcement les memes selon qu'une affaire soit regie par la Charte ou par les lois sur les droits de la personne; cependant, la Cour federale a applique a des affaires relevant de la LCDP la definition de la discrimination enoncee par la Cour supreme du Canada dans l'arret Andrews c. Law Society of British Columbia [1989] 1 RCS 143, et formulee en ces termes par le juge McIntyre :\nVI. Resume des observations de l'intime\nJ'affirmerais alors que la discrimination peut se decrire comme une distinction, intentionnelle ou non, mais fondee sur des motifs relatifs a des caracteristiques personnelles d'un individu ou d'un groupe d'individus, qui a pour effet d'imposer a cet individu ou a ce groupe des fardeaux, des obligations ou des desavantages non imposes a d'autres ou d'empecher ou de restreindre l'acces aux possibilites, aux benefices et aux avantages offerts a d'autres membres de la societe.\n[78] Le rejet de la demande presentee par la plaignante en vue de faire passer son droit a l'inscription de la categorie prevue a l'alinea 6(1)f) a celle prevue a l'alinea 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens n'a pas eu pour effet de lui imposer << des fardeaux, des obligations ou des desavantages non imposes a d'autres >> ni de << restreindre l'acces aux possibilites, aux benefices et aux avantages offerts a d'autres membres de la societe >>, que ce soit lors du depot de sa demande ou de la reception de la reponse de l'intime.\n[79] La seule difference objective entre le droit a l'inscription et a l'appartenance a une bande que la plaignante avait et ceux qu'elle demandait tenait au fait qu'avec les mesures correctives apportees a la Loi sur les Indiens par l'entremise de la LESIRI, entree en vigueur le 31 janvier 2011, la possibilite pour la plaignante de s'inscrire sous le regime de l'alinea 6(1)c) lui permettrait de transmettre son droit a l'inscription a ses petits-fils. Anterieurement, il n'y avait aucune difference entre les alineas 6(1)f) et 6(1)c) en matiere de transmission du statut. Independamment du statut de la plaignante sur le plan de l'inscription, ses petits-fils n'auraient pas pu etre inscrits a titre d'Indiens sous le regime de la Loi sur les Indiens avant le 31 janvier 2011. De plus, suivant l'article 11 de la Loi sur les Indiens, ils ne pouvaient faire ajouter leurs noms a la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope ou de la bande Gwichya Gwich'in.\n[80] L'intime soutient que les questions relatives aux droits ancestraux et issus de traites que la constitution garantit a la plaignante n'entrent pas dans le champ d'application de la presente plainte, laquelle porte sur l'inscription et l'appartenance a une bande sous le regime de la Loi sur les Indiens, et qui qu'il en soit, ces droits n'ont pas ete prouves.\n[81] Le champ d'application de la presente plainte a trait a la demande presentee par la plaignante le 2 juin 2010 en vue de faire modifier son statut d'inscription et sa bande d'appartenance en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens pour tenir compte du fait qu'elle a ete adoptee selon la coutume autochtone. C'est pourquoi les demandes d'indemnisation et les allegations de violations anterieures a cette demande depassent le champ d'application de la plainte.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

Les petits-fils de la plaignante ne pouvaient se prevaloir d'aucun avantage prevu par le Traite no 11 jusqu'a ce qu'ils obtiennent le droit d'etre membres de la bande de Fort Good Hope Band ou de la bande Gwichya Gwich'in, par suite de l'entree en vigueur de la LESIRI.\n[83] A supposer que le Tribunal ait competence pour entendre la plainte, que celle-ci ne soit pas devenue theorique et que le Tribunal conclue que l'intime a fait preuve de discrimination a l'egard de la plaignante, l'intime soutient, egalement a titre subsidiaire, que ses actes etaient fondes sur un motif justifiable au sens de l'alinea 15(1)g) et du paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP.\n[84] La demande de jugement declaratoire presentee par la plaignante depasse le champ d'application de la presente plainte et la competence du Tribunal, car les alineas 53(2)c) et d) de la LCDP ne l'autorisent pas a rendre un tel jugement. De plus, les temoignages entendus n'etablissent pas que les petits-enfants de la plaignante jouissent de droits issus d'un traite depuis la naissance. La preuve montre que la bande des Loucheaux no 6 est la bande Gwichya Gwich'in et que l'intime ne tient plus de liste de paiement des annuites prevues au traite pour la bande des Loucheaux no 6 depuis 1955.\n[85] On ne peut qualifier les actes de l'intime d'intentionnellement discriminatoires ou d'inconsideres, ce qui est une condition necessaire pour pouvoir rendre une ordonnance en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. Aucune preuve ne permet de conclure que l'intime [Traduction] << a agi d'une maniere qu'il savait - et peut-etre meme, qu'il voulait - discriminatoire >> a l'egard de la plaignante.\n[86] Dans l'eventualite ou la plainte de discrimination serait jugee fondee et ou une mesure de reparation d'interet public serait ordonnee, l'intime demande a ce que six mois lui soient accordes pour elaborer et mettre en oeuvre la Directive.\n[87] Le fait qu'apres son refus initial, l'intime ait revise sa position concernant les demandes presentees par la plaignante le 2 juin 2010 en vue d'etre inscrite sous le regime de l'alinea 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens et d'obtenir que son nom soit retranche de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope et ajoute a la liste de la bande Gwichya Gwich'in, compte tenu de son adoption selon la coutume autochtone, n'a pas pour effet, a mon sens, de rendre theoriques les questions de savoir si ce refus initial de l'intime constituait un acte discriminatoire au sens de l'article 5 de la LCDP et, le cas echeant, quelles mesures de reparation cet acte doit entrainer, s'il en est.\n[88] Bien que le Tribunal ne puisse imposer les mesures de reparation prevues a l'article 53 de la LCDP que s'il conclut que la plainte est fondee, le contraire n'est pas vrai. Le Tribunal peut conclure qu'une plainte est fondee sans imposer de telles mesures. Si une personne met fin a la conduite dont le plaignant pretend qu'elle est discriminatoire avant l'instruction de la plainte, le Tribunal peut neanmoins conclure que la plainte est fondee en ce qui concerne la periode precedant la cessation de la conduite, meme s'il est possible qu'aucune reparation ne soit ordonnee. Par consequent, une affaire ne devient pas theorique du seul fait que l'auteur des actes en cause decide d'y mettre fin ou qu'une ordonnance de reparation pourrait ne pas etre rendue, si le Tribunal conclut que l'acte etait discriminatoire pendant qu'il etait perpetre et que la plainte est fondee.\n[89] En l'espece, non seulement la question de la responsabilite est toujours d'actualite en ce qui concerne la conduite de l'intime avant qu'il ne revise sa position, mais la question des mesures de reparation a titre individuel comme de celles commandees par l'interet public continue egalement de se poser malgre le changement dans la position de l'intime.\n[90] Par ailleurs, puisque l'audience a eu lieu et que les parties ont pu debattre en profondeur, dans le cadre d'une procedure contradictoire, des questions faisant intervenir d'importants droits quasi constitutionnels, aucun argument legitime ne permet d'affirmer que des ressources judiciaires limitees seront ainsi gaspillees, etc., au vu des criteres etablis par la jurisprudence pour determiner si une affaire est theorique.

Analyse\nA. L'affaire est-elle devenue theorique ?\nB. A-t-il ete prouve qu'il y a eu discrimination ?\n(a) que l'intime fournissait des services << destines au public >>, au sens de l'article 5 de la LCDP ;\n(b) que l'intime a prive le plaignant d'un service ou l'a defavorise a l'occasion de sa fourniture ;\n(c) le refus ou la difference de traitement defavorable reposait en totalite ou en partie sur un motif de distinction illicite et/ou a eu un effet prejudiciable disproportionne sur des personnes caracterisees par un motif de distinction illicite.\n[93] Le critere minimal a respecter pour etablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination est peu exigeant. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les allegations qui ont ete faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est complete et suffit a justifier un verdict favorable a la partie plaignante, en l'absence de replique de la partie intimee. (Societe de soutien a l'enfance et a la famille des Premieres Nations c. Canada (Procureur general) 2012 CF 445 (SSEFPN))\n[94] La Cour supreme a statue en de nombreuses occasions que les lois relatives aux droits de la personne ont un caractere quasi constitutionnel et doivent recevoir une interpretation large, liberale et teleologique de maniere a garantir la pleine realisation de ses objectifs reparateurs. Il s'ensuit que l'analyse grammaticale stricte peut se trouver subordonnee a l'objet reparateur des dispositions sur les droits de la personne de facon a ce que dernier soit renforce plutot qu'affaibli. (S.S.E.F.P.N., precitee ; C.N.R. c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), (1987) A.C.F. no 42.)\n[95] La LCDP ne definit pas l'expression << [services] destines au public >>, mais selon la jurisprudence, le terme << services >> doit s'entendre, a l'article 5, de quelque chose d'avantageux qui est offert ou mis a la disposition du public dans le cadre d'une relation publique. Cela dit, il n'est pas obligatoire que le service soit accessible a tous les membres du public pour qu'il soit vise par l'article 5. Le fait qu'une partie du public puisse se prevaloir de ce service est suffisant. (Canada (Procureur general) c. Watkin, (2008) A.C.F. no 710; Canada (Procureur general) c. Rosin, (1991) 1. C.F. 391.)\n[96] En regle generale, les services que fournit le gouvernement sont tenus comme necessaires au public et avantageux, sans quoi il serait inutile de les fournir. Avantages et services ne sont pas forcement synonymes. Un service tel que le traitement d'une demande d'inscription en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens dont le but est de determiner si la demande satisfait aux exigences d'inscription prevues par la loi represente une tache necessaire que les fonctionnaires doivent accomplir pour le compte et au profit du public (c.-a-d. l'auteur de la demande). Au final, si l'execution de la tache aboutit a l'approbation de la demande et a l'inscription de son auteur, celui-ci pourra des lors obtenir certains avantages, tels que des services de sante non assures, la possibilite de demander le financement des etudes postsecondaires et certaines exemptions d'impot. Pour qu'une plainte soit fondee selon la LCDP, il faut conclure que le defaut de fournir le service a une personne d'une maniere exempte de discrimination, soit parce qu'elle en a ete privee, soit parce qu'elle a ete defavorisee sur la based'un motif de distinction illicite, a eu sur elle un effet prejudiciable ou negatif.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

Au moment ou la plaignante a presente sa demande, la LESIRI avait deja ete deposee et adoptee en premiere lecture, avec les dispositions mentionnees precedemment, en vertu desquelles ses petits-enfants pourraient pour la premiere fois etre inscrits sous le regime du paragraphe 6(2), a condition que l'intime reconnaisse son adoption selon la coutume autochtone pour les besoins de son inscription sous le regime de l'alinea 6(1)c). Ainsi, meme si la plaignante touchait deja les prestations associees a l'inscription sous le regime de l'alinea 6(1)f), l'intime, en rejetant initialement ses demandes de modification de son inscription et de la bande a laquelle elle appartenait en raison des mauvaises interpretations auxquelles il est arrive dans le cadre du traitement de ces demandes, lui a fait subir, ainsi qu'a ses descendants, les effets prejudiciables ou negatifs suivants :\ni) elle n'a pas beneficie d'une reconnaissance officielle en tant qu'enfant adoptee selon la coutume autochtone par des parents qui se sont dans les faits charges de l'elever depuis le moment ou elle a eu quatre jours. Malgre le fait que le registraire etait dispose a consigner dans les dossiers de la plaignante son adoption selon la coutume autochtone en decembre 2010, il a refuse, a la meme epoque, de donner un effet juridique a cette adoption dans le cadre de son regime de tenue des dossiers prevu a l'article 6. Ce refus de reconnaitre le caractere juridique du lien qui l'unit depuis toujours a ses parents adoptifs a eu sur elle un effet prejudiciable en portant atteinte a sa dignite en tant qu'enfant adoptee. Les tribunaux ont juge que la reconnaissance appropriee du lien parent enfant resultant d'une adoption constituait un service pouvant faire l'objet d'un controle judiciaire en vertu des lois sur les droits de la personne car elle s'inscrit dans un << processus de confirmation de la vie >>. (A.A. c. Nouveau-Brunswick (Ministere des Services familiaux et communautaires), (2004) N.B.H.R.B.I.D. no 4.)\nii) elle n'a pas beneficie de la possibilite de faire retrancher son nom de la liste de la bande a laquelle elle ne souhaitait plus appartenir sur simple presentation d'une demande en ce sens, ce qui a egalement porte atteinte a sa dignite. Le mot << transfert >> ne figure ni a l'article 9, ni a l'article 12 de la Loi sur les Indiens, de sorte que la personne dont le nom apparait dans la liste de bande et qui souhaite plutot le voir figurer a une autre liste de bande (ou qui veut tout simplement ne figurer sur aucune liste) ne peut obtenir que son nom soit retranche de la liste de la bande dont elle ne veut plus faire partie en presentant une simple demande a cet effet, s'evitant ainsi de devoir entreprendre une demarche inutile, humiliante et chronophage afin d'obtenir le consentement des bandes concernees, comme l'a d'abord exige l'intime en l'espece.\niii) elle n'a pas beneficie de la possibilite de transmettre a ses enfants le statut prevu a l'alinea 6(1)c.1) (au lieu de celui du paragraphe 6(2)) et, par le fait meme, de transmettre a ses petits-enfants (qui, autrement, n'avaient pas droit a l'inscription) le statut prevu au paragraphe 6(2) au moment de l'entree en vigueur de la LESIRI le 31 janvier 2011, ce qui a eu pour effet de priver ses enfants de l'acces aux avantages tangibles offerts aux personnes inscrites a titre qu'Indiens.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

Ayant declare l'article 6 inoperant parce que contraire a la Charte canadienne des droits et libertes, la Cour d'appel a reconnu que la faculte de transmettre le statut a son enfant etait un avantage confere par la Loi sur les Indiens, en prenant soin de preciser qu'elle serait encline a tirer la meme conclusion quant a la faculte de transmettre son statut a ses petits-enfants. La LESIRI avait deja ete deposee au Parlement lorsque les demandes ont ete presentees en juin 2010 et, a n'en pas douter, toutes les parties etaient au courant des nouvelles dispositions a cette epoque. Il est, a mon sens, tout a fait comprehensible que la plaignante ait attendu a juin 2010 pour demander la modification de son statut puisqu'en l'absence de la LESIRI, l'inscription n'aurait offert a ses petits-enfants aucun avantage tangible. Par consequent, le fait qu'elle ait attendu au mois de juin 2010 pour presenter ses demandes et le delai ecoule entre le depot des demandes et l'entree en vigueur de la LESIRI ne sont ni importants, ni pertinents en l'espece. (McIvor v. Canada (Registrar, Indian and Northern Affairs), 2009 BCCA 153.)\n[99] Une distinction fondamentale peut etre etablie entre les faits de l'espece et les affaires Murphy, Matson et Andrews en ce sens que dans ces affaires, les plaintes ne concernaient pas des actes commis par une personne exercant un pouvoir discretionnaire dans l'application des lois en cause. Ces plaintes etaient plutot dirigees contre les lois en question, sans plus. Dans toutes ces affaires, l'objet veritablement poursuivi par les plaignants en invoquant la LCDP etait d'obtenir que le legislateur apporte des modifications aux lois memes et non pas a la facon dont les fonctionnaires exercaient quelque pouvoir discretionnaire dans l'application de ces lois. L'excellent temoin produit par l'intime, Mme Linda McLeynachan, a en fait declare que les fonctionnaires de l'intime avaient fini par reviser leur position concernant la demande d'inscription non pas parce que le libelle des dispositions en question avait ete modifie par une loi federale, mais parce qu'ils etaient arrives a une autre interpretation de ces dispositions apres les avoir examinees [Traduction] << sous un autre angle >>. L'intime a reconnu que son interpretation initiale etait erronee, et non qu'il fallait de nouvelles dispositions legales.\n[100] Par consequent, il ne fait aucun doute qu'en l'espece, il etait possible d'user de discretion pour interpreter les dispositions legales dans un sens ou dans l'autre, que ce soit par rapport a la demande visant la modification de l'inscription ou a visant la suppression d'un nom de la liste des effectifs d'une bande. Au depart, l'intime a rejete les demandes en se fondant sur une interpretation erronee des dispositions. Toutefois, il a fini par modifier sa position sans que le legislateur ne modifie la loi. Ainsi, l'intime savait, de toute evidence, qu'il avait le pouvoir discretionnaire de reviser sa position sans qu'il soit necessaire de faire modifier la loi, sans quoi il ne l'aurait pas fait. Vraisemblablement, ce changement de position reposait sur ce qui pourrait etre qualifie d'interpretation plus [Traduction] << souple, genereuse et axee sur l'objet de la loi >>. Le fait que les conseillers juridiques de l'intime aient ete appeles a fournir leur interpretation des dispositions dans cette affaire ne modifie pas la nature du travail effectue par ses fonctionnaires responsables du traitement des demandes de facon a en faire autre chose qu'un service destine au public, et ce, meme si l'intime a fini par juger que les avis juridiques obtenus au depart etaient errones et devaient etre revises.\n[101] En optant, au depart, pour une interpretation restrictive du terme << enfant >> figurant dans la Loi des Indiens de 1927, de facon a exclure les enfants adoptes selon la coutume autochtone, de meme que pour une interpretation restrictive de l'article 12 de la Loi sur les Indiens, de facon a exclure la possibilite de retrancher, sur demande de l'interesse, un nom figurant dans une liste de bande visee par l'article 11, l'intime exercait son pouvoir discretionnaire dans le cadre de la prestation de services de traitement des demandes.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

Lorsque le libelle d'une disposition legale comporte quelque ambiguite susceptible de plus d'une interpretation, le ministere responsable de son application est tenu, selon la LCDP, de retenir l'interpretation la plus compatible avec les principes en matiere de droits de la personne. (Hughes c. Elections Canada, 2010 TCDP 4)\n[103] La position initialement adoptee par l'intime par rapport a la demande d'inscription presentee sous le regime de l'alinea 6(1)c) et au retrait du nom de la plaignante de la liste des effectifs de la bande d'appartenance de ses parents biologiques reposait, dans un cas comme dans l'autre, sur des interpretations erronees de la Loi sur les Indiens qui ont cause a la plaignante et a ses descendants des effets prejudiciables qui ont dure environ deux ans et demi, comme cela a ete mentionne au paragraphe 97 des presents motifs. L'intime a degage ces interpretations en suivant une demarche formaliste et rigide qui : (i) ne reconnaissait pas aux enfants adoptes selon la coutume autochtone la qualite d'<< enfant >> au sens de la Loi des Indiens de 1927; (ii) limitait le droit a l'inscription des personnes qui avaient ete adoptees selon la coutume autochtone avant le 17 avril 1985, mais qui presentaient une premiere demande d'inscription apres cette date au regime prevu a l'alinea 6(1)f) ou au paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens; (iii) ne permettait pas qu'un nom soit retranche de la liste d'une bande sans le consentement d'un tiers.\n[104] L'intime est arrive a ces interpretations initiales erronees parce qu'il a ecarte les methodes d'interpretation larges, liberales et teleologiques mentionnees au paragraphe 94 des presents motifs et qu'il n'a pas retenu les interpretations les plus compatibles avec les principes relatifs aux droits de la personne auxquels il est fait allusion au paragraphe 102, ci-dessus. Au lieu de recourir a [Traduction] << un angle nouveau >> pour modifier ulterieurement ses interpretations, l'intime aurait du, d'entree de jeu, s'ouvrir les yeux sur les interpretations correctes. Cela nous aurait epargne beaucoup de temps et de labeur.\n[105] Le refus initial de l'intime de modifier la categorie d'inscription de la plaignante et de l'autoriser a retirer son nom de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope, refus qui a dure deux ans et demi et qui reposait sur des interpretations legislatives erronees, revenait a priver la plaignante d'un service au sens de l'alinea 5a) de la LCDP puisque les actes de l'intime comportaient une evaluation irreguliere et discriminatoire de son droit a l'inscription sous le regime de l'alinea 6(1)c) et de son droit de demander a ce que son nom soit retranche de la liste d'une bande a laquelle elle ne souhaitait plus appartenir. Les actes de l'intime ont egalement defavorise la plaignante a l'occasion de la prestation d'un service au sens de l'alinea 5b) car ils procedaient de l'etablissement d'une distinction defavorable des enfants adoptes par rapport aux enfants biologiques dans le cadre de l'interpretation de dispositions legales.\n[106] En l'espece, le refus ou le traitement defavorable etait fonde sur l'etat de la plaignante en tant que personne adoptee selon la coutume autochtone et, par consequent, il releve du motif de distinction illicite fonde sur la << situation de famille >> suivant l'article 3 de la LCDP. Le Tribunal et les tribunaux judiciaires ont statue que la situation de famille englobait la relation entre parents et enfants adoptifs et que les distinctions prejudiciables etablies entre enfants adoptifs et enfants biologiques constituaient un acte discriminatoire fonde sur la situation de famille qui etait interdit par la LCDP. Je suis d'avis que l'enfant dont l'adoption selon la coutume autochtone a ete certifiee a droit au meme traitement selon la loi que l'enfant adopte legalement. (Seeley c. Canadian National Railway, 2010 TCDP 23; Canada (Procureur general) c. McKenna, (1998) 1 A.C.F. no 1501; Grismer c. Bande indienne de Squamish, 2006 CF 1088; Worthington c. Canada, 2008 CF 409.)\n[107] Une fois que le plaignant a etabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l'article 5 de la LCDP, il incombe a l'intime de refuter cette preuve, soit en demontrant que les faits allegues n'ont pas eu lieu, soit que sa conduite repose sur un motif justifiable, suivant l'alinea 15(1)g) ou le paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

(2) A l'issue de l'instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fondee, peut, sous reserve de l'article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, a la personne trouvee coupable d'un acte discriminatoire :\na) de mettre fin a l'acte et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement a leurs objectifs generaux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destinees a prevenir des actes semblables, notamment :\n(i) d'adopter un programme, un plan ou un arrangement vises au paragraphe 16(1),\n(ii) de presenter une demande d'approbation et de mettre en oeuvre un programme prevus a l'article 17;\nb) d'accorder a la victime, des que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l'acte l'a privee;\nc) d'indemniser la victime de la totalite, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des depenses entrainees par l'acte;\nd) d'indemniser la victime de la totalite, ou de la fraction des frais supplementaires occasionnes par le recours a d'autres biens, services, installations ou moyens d'hebergement, et des depenses entrainees par l'acte;\ne) d'indemniser jusqu'a concurrence de 20 000 $ la victime qui a souffert un prejudice moral.\n(3) Outre les pouvoirs que lui confere le paragraphe (2), le membre instructeur peut ordonner a l'auteur d'un acte discriminatoire de payer a la victime une indemnite maximale de 20 000 $, s'il en vient a la conclusion que l'acte a ete delibere ou inconsidere.\n[112] Comme cela a ete signale aux paragraphes 67 et 68 des presents motifs, la plaignante demande, en guise de reparation pour elle-meme et pour ses descendants, un jugement declaratoire ainsi qu'une ordonnance de paiement pour la violation des droits individuels issus d'un traite, violation qui, selon elle, decoule de la violation par l'intime des droits issus du Traite no 11. Sur ce point, la plaignante a tente d'elargir le champ d'application de la plainte pour englober davantage que ce sur quoi elle porte reellement et dont il est question au paragraphe 2 des presents motifs, a savoir le rejet par l'intime des demandes qu'elle lui a presentees en juin 2010 en vue d'obtenir la modification de son statut d'inscription et le retrait de son nom de la liste de son ancienne bande. Je n'ai pas la competence voulue pour rendre ce genre de decision declaratoire ni pour ordonner de tels paiements : cela tient a la fois au fait que la plaignante n'a produit aucune preuve a l'audience afin d'etayer cet argument et que ces allegations et les reparations demandees debordent le cadre des questions en litige dans l'instance et celui des dispositions legislatives applicables en matiere de reparation et reproduites ci-dessus.\n\nFonte: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law"}]}

Dans ces circonstances, ce serait faire preuve d'iniquite envers l'intime que de rendre une ordonnance en vertu de cet alinea, malgre les conclusions que j'ai tirees quant aux repercussions de ses actes discriminatoires. Cela dit, compte tenu de la preuve portee a ma connaissance, j'ai le sentiment que l'intime a refuse les demandes de la plaignante en sachant tres bien quelles seraient les consequences de son geste pour la plaignante et ses descendants, et il a mis plus de deux ans et demi avant de revenir sur sa position. A mon avis, les interpretations pour lesquelles il a opte ulterieurement relativement aux demandes auraient du lui apparaitre clairement des le depart, du fait de l'attitude liberale et soucieuse de l'objet de la loi qu'il convient d'adopter lorsqu'il s'agit d'interpreter des lois de cette nature dans un tel contexte. Par consequent, j'estime qu'il s'est conduit a cet egard de maniere deliberee et que ses actes tombent sous le coup des dispositions du paragraphe 53(3) susmentionne.\n[114] De la meme facon, j'estime que les reparations demandees par la Commission dans l'interet public sont de mise, sous reserve du fait que le delai de six mois demande par l'intime pour elaborer et mettre en oeuvre les directives lui sera accorde. A cet egard, je me rejouis d'apprendre qu'a l'epoque de l'instruction de la plainte, l'intime avait deja amorce la redaction des directives necessaires.\n[115] Par consequent, le Tribunal ordonne ce qui suit :\nX. Ordonnance\nQue l'intime mette fin aux actes discriminatoires suivants :\ni) le refus de reconnaitre l'enfant adoptif d'un Indien du sexe masculin comme etant l'<< enfant >> de cet Indien, au sens ou ce terme est entendu dans la Loi des Indiens de 1927;\nii) le refus d'examiner les demandes visant une premiere inscription des enfants adoptes avant le 17 avril 1985 sous le regime de toute autre disposition que l'alinea 6(1)f) ou le paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens;\nQue l'intime, dans les six mois suivant la date de la decision du Tribunal :\ni) remette un bulletin, une directive ou un document comparable a tous les membres du personnel concernes par le traitement des demandes d'inscription sous le regime de la Loi sur les Indiens afin de les informer de ce qui suit : (i) le terme << enfant >>, au sens entendu dans la Loi des Indiens de 1927, doit etre interprete de facon a inclure tant les enfants adoptifs que les enfants biologiques; (ii) les personnes qui ont ete adoptees avant 1985 pourraient avoir le droit d'etre inscrites a titre d'Indien en vertu d'autres dispositions que l'al. 6(1)f) ou le paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens, tout dependant de la situation particuliere de chacun;\nii) transmette a la Commission un exemplaire du bulletin, de la directive ou de tout document comparable, accompagne d'une confirmation que le bulletin a ete remis a tous les membres du personnel concernes par le traitement des demandes d'inscription sous le regime de la Loi sur les Indiens.\nQue l'intime, dans le mois suivant la date de la decision du Tribunal, verse a la plaignante la somme de 5 000,00 $ au titre de l'indemnite speciale prevue au paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP.\nSignee par\nWallace G.

Files are in subfolders with the court/tribunal names.\nDataset Creation\nCuration Rationale\nBuilding on the RLL's earlier bulk-data programme, A2AJ is collecting and sharing Canadian legal data to:\ndemocratise access to Canadian jurisprudence;\nenable large-scale empirical legal studies; and\nsupport responsible AI development for the justice sector.\nWe scrape data only where we are permitted to do so by terms of service of websites that host the data. We also obtain some additional data directly from courts and tribunals.\nSource Data & Normalisation\nCases are scraped directly from the official websites of the respective courts and tribunals, or is obtained directly from the tribunals through email or other distruction processes. Where possible, text is stored verbatim with minimal normalisation (e.g. HTML - plain text, whitespace cleanup).\nPersonal & Sensitive Information\nCourt and tribunal decisions can contain sensitive personal information. Although all documents are already public, easy bulk access increases privacy risk--particularly for refugees, criminal-justice-involved persons and other marginalised groups. Users who reproduce the data from this dataset are responsible for complying with relevant privacy laws, as well as other laws relating to disseminating information such as publication bans.\nNon-Official Versions & Disclaimer\nThe texts here are unofficial copies. For authoritative versions, consult the URLs in\nurl_en\n/\nurl_fr\n.\nNon-Affiliation / Endorsement\nA2AJ and the production of this dataset are not affiliated with, nor endorsed by, the Government of Canada, provincial courts, or the listed tribunals.\nConsiderations for Using the Data\nSocial Impact.\nOpen legal data can reduce information asymmetries but also facilitate surveillance or discriminatory profiling. We encourage downstream users to collaborate with community organisations and ensure that derivative tools advance--rather than undermine--access to justice.\nBias & Representativeness.\nPublished decisions are not a random sample of disputes. For example, positive administrative decisions are less likely to be appealed and thus under-represented in court records. Models trained on this corpus may therefore skew negative.\nLimitations.\nThe dataset excludes annexes, schedules and appendices that are sometimes attached as separate PDFs. Long historical gaps exist for some courts (e.g. ONCA pre-1990).\nLicensing Information\nThe code used to create the dataset by the A2AJ and any work on the dataset undertaken by the A2AJ is subject to an open source\nMIT license\n.\nUsers must also comply with upstream licenses found in the\nupstream_license\nfield in the dataset for each document, which reflects the licenses through which the A2AJ obtained the document. These upstream licenses may include limits on commercial use, as well as other limitations.\nThe A2AJ is committed to open source methodologies, and we are actively working to obtain more permissive licenses for this data.\nWarranties / Representations\nWhile we make best efforts to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the dataset, we provide no warranties regarding completeness or accuracy. The data were collected through automated processes and may contain errors. Always verify data against the official source.\nDataset Curators\nSean Rehaag\n- Co-Diretor, A2AJ\nSimon Wallace\n- Co-Director, A2AJ\nContact:\na2aj@yorku.ca\nCitation\nSean Rehaag & Simon Wallace,\n\"A2AJ Canadian Case Law\"\n(2025), online: Hugging Face Datasets\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/a2aj/canadian-case-law\n.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research output is supported in part by funding from the\nLaw Foundation of Ontario\nand the\nSocial Scienes and Humanities Research Council of Canada\n, by in-kind compute from the\nDigital Research Alliance of Canada\nand by adminstrative support from the\nCentre for Refugee Studies\n, the\nRefugee Law Lab\n, and\nOsgoode Hall Law School\n.
